Things to be done
-----------------

#. We need to de-couple the dataset from the classifiers
   We can follow scikit's dataset.target and dataset.data approach
   This will make it easier for MI to deal with data before classification

#. We need add pruning and MI again to our code

#. After decoupling dataset from classifier, we need utilities
   to convert textual data (files) to our dataset

#. We need to implement Ye's shapelet classifier

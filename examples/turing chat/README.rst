Question and Answer
===================

qa.py is a *very* simple implementation of a computer-based question & answer program,
a la Alan Turing tests.

It basically reads a list of questions and answers from qa.txt,
then it uses IR/Euclidean distance to search for the best matching question,
and returns the answer for the retrieved question.

I've noticed the Euclidean distance performs much better than cosine distance,
since we are searching in very short documents (questions).

I do not think we need to convert our vecotr space into TF.IDF, 
once more, beacuase we are searching in very short documents.

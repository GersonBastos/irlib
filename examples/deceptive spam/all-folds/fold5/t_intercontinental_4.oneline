i
stayed
at
ich
chicago
for
business
in
november
of
and
loved
it
as
a
royal
ambassador
member
they
upgraded
me
to
a
beautiful
junior
suite
with
a
separate
living
and
working
area
and
bathrooms
my
upgrade
was
in
place
upon
arrival
and
a
beautiful
fruit
basket
was
waiting
for
me
on
the
coffee
table
they
even
had
a
nice
young
lady
escort
me
to
my
room
the
suite
was
beautifully
furnished
and
had
an
art
deco
feel
to
it
the
only
thing
i
regretted
was
that
i
only
stayed
one
night
i
will
definitely
stay
here
on
my
next
visit

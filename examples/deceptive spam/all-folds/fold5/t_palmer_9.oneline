we
just
returned
from
a
girls
shopping
sight
seeing
trip
the
palmer
house
was
like
home
away
from
home
the
hotel
is
undergoing
renovations
but
we
did
not
notice
any
inconveniences
or
hear
any
noise
from
the
work
the
lobby
was
breathtaking
all
dressed
up
for
christmas
the
staff
from
check
in
to
housekeeping
was
very
welcoming
and
friendly
our
room
was
updated
with
two
beds
and
two
separate
baths
which
was
great
for
everyone
to
have
their
own
personal
space
i
would
not
hesitate
to
recommend
this
hotel
to
anyone
chicago
is
a
great
town

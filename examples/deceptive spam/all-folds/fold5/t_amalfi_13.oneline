we
arrived
for
a
weekend
stay
and
really
enjoyed
the
hotel
the
cocktail
hour
was
so
full
of
people
that
we
could
not
get
in
the
second
night
we
went
earlier
and
it
was
very
nice
the
staff
was
very
helpful
and
had
a
good
knowledge
of
the
area
the
rooms
were
modern
and
very
clean
we
will
stay
there
again

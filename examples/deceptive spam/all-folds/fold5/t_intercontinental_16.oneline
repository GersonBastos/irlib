the
hotel
is
beautiful
it
is
an
excellent
location
there
was
a
few
minor
issues
the
hotel
is
clearly
geared
toward
the
convention
and
business
crowd
there
were
charges
for
almost
everything
although
i
did
not
incur
any
of
these
our
room
was
a
little
small
for
the
class
of
hotel
but
not
overwhelmingly
small
not
a
true
complaint
but
the
elevators
were
very
slow
my
comparison
was
that
we
stayed
in
an
equally
aged
hotel
in
a
different
city
during
our
trip
and
the
intercontinentalgs
were
significantly
slower
thatgs
it
no
more
little
nit
picks
the
staff
was
excellent
the
doormen
being
the
highlight
the
hotel
bar
was
also
very
nice
the
hotel
was
immaculately
clean
i
would
definitely
travel
to
this
hotel
again

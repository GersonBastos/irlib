the
amalfi
hotel
has
become
my
absolute
favorite
place
to
stay
when
i
visit
chicago
this
place
really
knows
how
to
treat
their
guests
they
serve
a
complimentary
breakfast
on
every
floor
and
even
have
ipod
docking
stations
in
the
room
if
you
want
to
watch
a
movie
you
can
just
borrow
it
from
their
collection
i
took
advantage
of
the
free
wi
fi
and
the
plush
bathrobes
while
i
stayed
there
i
had
to
try
the
spa
services
that
were
offered
wonderful
experience
the
staff
really
made
me
feel
comfortable
during
my
stay
and
i
will
definitely
be
staying
there
again
on
my
next
trip
to
chicago

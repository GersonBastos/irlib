at
the
intercontinental
chicago
you
pay
for
more
than
a
room
you
pay
for
an
experience
let
me
elaborate
i
was
a
bit
reluctant
to
pay
a
premium
for
location
and
amenities
like
any
novice
traveller
to
chicago
i
saw
the
mass
glut
of
cheap
accommodations
out
in
the
suburbs
and
those
were
originally
what
i
set
my
sights
on
price
is
a
powerful
signal
and
the
sheer
discount
of
those
options
drew
me
in
but
after
doing
a
bit
of
research
i
realised
that
distance
does
have
its
costs
the
price
of
transit
in
the
chicagoland
area
isngt
free
and
itgs
far
from
what
igm
used
to
car
use
is
price
prohibitive
i
knew
that
originally
which
is
why
i
wasngt
going
to
drive
but
the
sting
of
using
the
automobile
parking
congestion
toll
roads
etc
gets
shoved
off
onto
taxi
fares
and
auto
rental
so
i
ultimately
had
to
end
up
looking
for
a
place
well
connected
with
mass
transit
but
mass
transit
has
its
costs
too
which
meant
that
staying
at
a
focal
point
downtown
had
its
advantages
thatgs
what
originally
drew
me
to
intercontinental
but
intercontinental
is
much
more
than
the
right
room
at
the
right
place
the
decor
of
the
rooms
and
the
amenities
available
to
the
guest
are
unsurpassable
i
was
travelling
on
international
business
so
the
ease
with
which
i
could
transact
in
foreign
currency
was
a
draw
they
had
a
currency
exchange
right
there
on
the
premises
and
the
fact
that
massages
dry
cleaning
and
event
planning
were
available
in
house
was
a
huge
plus
my
work
gets
me
tied
up
in
knots
it
also
leaves
little
time
for
doing
chores
so
the
ability
to
grab
a
massage
while
my
suits
were
being
finished
was
a
relief
for
me
but
on
top
of
all
that
the
event
planning
was
what
put
intercontinental
over
the
top
being
able
to
coordinate
a
comprehensive
tour
of
chicago
while
completing
my
business
and
managing
my
personal
life
was
a
weight
off
my
shoulders
and
something
i
wongt
forget
in
the
end
if
yougre
a
newcomer
to
chicago
staying
in
a
time
crunch
the
intercontinental
is
for
you
the
pricetag
of
rooming
downtown
can
seem
prohibitive
but
when
you
factor
in
the
convenience
and
savings
in
marginal
costs
itgs
nothing
in
the
end
and
the
intercontinental
is
not
only
price
competitive
with
the
other
downtown
options
it
also
makes
staying
downtown
the
convenience
and
thrill
it
should
be

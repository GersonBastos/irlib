the
palmer
house
hilton
was
recommended
to
me
by
a
friend
who
had
visited
chicago
the
previous
summer
i
was
very
happy
with
the
location
and
was
able
to
visit
the
nearby
lake
michigan
and
millennium
park
beautiful
the
rooms
were
good
size
and
the
right
amount
of
luxury
for
the
price
i
didngt
use
room
service
much
but
when
i
did
everything
was
in
order

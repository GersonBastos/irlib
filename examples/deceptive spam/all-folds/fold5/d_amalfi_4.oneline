my
fiance
and
i
had
taken
a
trip
to
chicago
and
wanted
to
stay
someplace
close
to
downtown
so
he
chose
the
amalfi
hotel
located
conveniently
to
everything
we
needed
this
place
was
phenomenal
he
chose
a
romantic
getaway
package
as
we
were
only
in
town
for
a
few
days
and
it
was
the
best
choice
ever
the
hotel
is
super
clean
and
very
chicg
the
beds
are
so
comfortable
and
the
staff
is
superb
we
were
able
to
bring
along
our
dog
which
was
also
really
important
to
us
the
first
day
we
were
there
we
had
gone
out
during
the
day
with
our
dog
and
came
back
to
an
in
room
couplegs
massage
the
masseuses
come
straight
to
your
room
so
itgs
really
relaxing
and
stress
relieving
and
they
were
great
after
our
massages
we
went
to
the
keefer
steakhouse
which
the
hotel
gave
us
a
gift
certificate
for
and
the
food
was
fantastic
they
do
also
have
a
great
continental
breakfast
and
we
did
also
eat
at
the
rocket
grill
which
was
nice
as
well
in
all
our
nights
there
were
pretty
similar
we
went
out
during
the
day
and
had
a
great
time
at
the
hotel
while
we
were
thereg
igve
recommended
this
place
to
a
few
of
my
clients
going
to
the
windy
city

my
husband
and
i
stayed
at
the
palmer
house
hilton
in
chicago
for
our
anniversary
the
hotel
was
beautiful
and
luxurious
as
one
would
expect
from
a
hilton
brand
hotel
in
a
major
city
the
service
was
excellent
with
check
in
and
check
out
going
smoothly
the
location
of
the
hotel
was
ideal
for
us
as
we
had
plans
to
attend
the
theater
visit
the
lincoln
park
zoo
and
picnic
by
the
lake
all
of
these
were
very
close
to
our
hotel
the
price
was
reasonable
for
the
location
and
luxurious
accommodations
we
also
enjoyed
the
hotel
restaurant
and
lounge
highly
recommend

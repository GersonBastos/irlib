my
friends
and
i
were
in
chicago
last
month
and
were
looking
for
a
resonably
priced
hotel
in
a
decent
neighborhood
well
we
came
across
the
hotel
allegro
and
immediately
fell
in
love
everything
from
the
colors
the
staff
the
architecture
and
the
pricing
were
amazing
we
couldngt
have
found
a
better
hotel
the
service
was
impeccable
talk
about
a
star
hotel
for
someone
with
a
star
budget
my
friends
and
i
plan
on
staying
here
next
year
when
we
return
i
cangt
wait
until
then

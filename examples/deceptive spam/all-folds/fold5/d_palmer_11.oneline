i
stayed
here
with
my
family
when
we
were
in
chicago
on
a
family
vacation
all
i
can
say
is
wow
a
fantastic
experience
all
around
first
off
the
hotel
is
magnificent
the
lobby
entreway
is
jaw
dropping
to
say
the
least
everyone
we
dealt
with
from
the
desk
clerks
to
the
cleaning
staff
to
the
doormen
were
all
exceptionally
cordial
and
friendly
the
rooms
themselves
are
fantastic
perfect
for
a
business
person
there
for
a
stay
or
for
a
family
there
for
recreation
the
new
serenity
beds
that
the
hilton
offered
were
to
die
for
one
of
the
most
restful
nights
sleep
i
have
had
in
years
the
kids
loved
the
ipod
docks
in
the
rooms
and
my
wife
and
i
loved
th
fact
the
kids
could
keep
their
bedroom
ice
cold
like
they
like
it
and
we
could
keep
it
warmer
in
ours
as
usual
it
had
wifi
which
was
ultra
cheap
and
very
very
fast
over
all
i
highly
recommend
the
palmer
house
hilton

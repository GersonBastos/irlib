igve
stayed
at
the
allegro
a
couple
of
times
like
the
other
kimpton
properties
itgs
a
classic
old
hotel
thatgs
been
beautifully
updated
i
found
the
staff
to
be
cordial
and
i
really
like
their
corporate
culture
theygre
pet
friendly
although
i
wasngt
travelling
with
the
dog
i
got
a
recycling
bin
in
my
room
aveda
products
in
the
bath
and
they
dongt
clean
with
toxic
chemicals
the
rooms
arengt
huge
and
the
bathrooms
arengt
what
yougre
going
to
get
at
a
hilton
what
the
allegro
lacks
in
square
footage
it
more
than
makes
up
for
in
cool
ok
they
may
be
a
little
pricey
but
igm
willing
to
pay
a
bit
more
considering
the
higher
cost
of
doing
business
responsibily

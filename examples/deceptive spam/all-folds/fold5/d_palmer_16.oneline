my
husband
and
i
snagged
a
great
deal
on
a
weekend
trip
to
chicago
and
decided
at
the
recommendation
of
friends
to
stay
at
the
palmer
house
hilton
the
only
word
we
can
use
to
describe
it
is
amazing
walking
into
the
lobby
feels
like
stepping
back
in
time
it
is
simply
breath
taking
be
sure
to
check
out
the
ceiling
i
have
never
seen
one
so
beautiful
outside
of
europe
we
checked
in
without
any
issues
and
were
assigned
a
very
lovely
room
with
the
most
comfortable
bed
i
have
encountered
in
any
hotel
everything
is
in
walking
distance
of
the
palmer
house
you
couldngt
hope
to
find
a
better
location
for
exploring
downtown
chicago
everything
was
perfect
with
our
stay
here
i
would
not
stay
anywhere
else
in
chicago
from
now
on

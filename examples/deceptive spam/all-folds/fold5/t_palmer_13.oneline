my
wife
and
i
stayed
for
nights
and
loved
it
our
stay
was
booked
for
us
by
virgin
atlantic
when
we
booked
our
flights
from
london
to
chicago
we
were
not
quite
sure
what
to
expect
but
were
reassured
by
the
hilton
brand
name
in
the
event
we
found
that
the
airline
knew
what
they
were
doing
when
they
suggested
this
hotel
on
arrrival
we
got
a
warm
welcome
and
the
check
in
was
quick
and
efficient
the
interior
of
the
hotel
is
spectacular
and
looks
like
has
been
refurbished
to
reflect
the
decor
as
it
would
have
been
when
it
was
built
the
room
we
were
given
was
a
good
size
with
queen
bed
which
was
particularly
comfortable
the
hotel
is
conveniently
located
with
restaurants
nearby
the
first
night
we
ate
at
the
hotelgs
own
gourmet
restaurant
the
lockwood
which
did
not
disappoint
the
breakfasts
are
also
served
in
this
restaurant
we
had
the
buffet
both
mornings
and
these
were
good
value
for
the
quality
offered
generally
we
found
the
service
in
this
hotel
good
and
the
staff
very
helpful
a
nice
touch
was
that
when
we
checked
out
of
the
hotel
to
go
to
our
next
destination
the
car
we
had
booked
to
pick
us
up
was
a
few
minutes
late
arriving
a
member
of
staff
supervising
the
doormen
saw
us
looking
a
bit
lost
and
came
over
to
assist
us
find
the
car
when
it
did
arrive
overall
i
would
thoroughly
recommend
this
hotel
for
both
business
and
leisure
stays
for
both
quality
and
value
for
money

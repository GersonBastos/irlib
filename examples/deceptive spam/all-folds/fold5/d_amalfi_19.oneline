last
weekend
my
wife
and
i
decided
to
take
a
weekend
trip
to
chicago
when
looking
for
a
hotel
we
werengt
all
that
interested
in
price
but
more
of
a
relaxing
getaway
in
the
heart
of
downtown
i
did
some
research
and
and
came
across
the
amalfi
hotel
chicago
what
sparked
my
interest
was
itgs
location
and
the
fact
that
they
offer
in
room
spa
treatments
located
in
chicagogs
river
north
area
it
is
close
to
the
magnificent
mile
so
we
can
get
all
of
our
shopping
done
while
staying
relatively
close
to
the
hotel
and
also
do
some
sightseeing
along
the
chicago
river
on
one
of
many
chicago
boat
tours
both
of
which
were
fantastic
after
a
long
day
out
on
the
town
we
came
back
to
the
hotel
to
induldge
in
their
in
room
spa
treatments
my
wife
got
the
whole
works
facial
manicure
and
pedicure
and
hot
stone
massage
therapy
while
i
enjoyed
a
deep
tissue
massage
to
get
rid
of
some
of
the
pain
from
walking
around
all
day
for
dinner
we
went
downstairs
and
enjoyed
a
fabulous
dinner
at
harry
caraygs
italian
steakhouse
best
steak
igve
ever
had
hands
down
when
we
were
finished
with
dinner
we
just
wanted
to
go
back
to
our
room
and
relax
so
we
hopped
into
our
comfortable
king
size
bed
put
in
a
movie
with
their
in
room
dvd
players
and
beautiful
inch
hdtvgs
for
anyone
looking
for
a
nice
relaxing
getaway
to
the
great
city
of
chicago
i
would
recommend
the
amalfi
hotel
chicago
to
anyone

offer
anything
you
could
ever
want
in
a
luxury
hotel

my
stay
at
the
palmer
house
hilton
was
wonderful
i
was
attracted
to
this
hotel
because
it
was
going
to
be
me
and
my
financegs
first
time
in
chicago
the
location
of
the
hotel
was
perfectly
placed
downtown
chicago
we
took
advantage
of
the
hilton
bed
and
breakfast
special
upon
check
in
on
friday
afternoon
we
went
to
the
lockwood
restaurant
before
going
to
the
room
for
the
weekend
we
stayed
in
a
one
bedroom
suite
with
a
king
size
bed
the
hotel
was
spotless
i
have
never
been
in
a
hotel
room
that
was
so
clean
the
portions
of
food
was
perfect
and
everything
they
provided
was
on
point

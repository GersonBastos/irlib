this
hotel
allowed
me
to
experience
the
best
of
chicago
the
central
downtown
location
was
perfect
for
me
and
my
boyfriend
to
come
and
go
as
we
pleased
whether
during
the
day
or
at
night
it
was
a
great
get
away
spot
for
me
to
relax
away
from
work
probably
one
of
the
best
beds
igve
ever
slept
on
the
italian
food
that
they
served
at
harry
careygs
reminded
me
of
when
i
lived
in
italy
overall
a
completely
amazing
experience
i
cangt
wait
to
book
my
next
stay
here

my
stay
at
the
hotel
allegro
chicago
was
an
amazing
experience
the
staff
were
helpful
and
considerate
always
there
to
tend
to
my
needs
my
suite
was
extremely
clean
and
had
all
the
amenities
that
i
could
ask
for
i
almost
didngt
want
to
leave
my
room
because
it
was
so
nice
but
in
the
end
i
did
because
the
hotel
is
situated
in
such
a
great
area
that
i
had
to
go
out
and
see
some
of
the
sites
this
hotel
has
wonderful
rooms
and
service
and
is
in
a
really
great
area
i
suggest
that
everyone
come
here
if
they
are
staying
in
chicago

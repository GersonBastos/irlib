attended
a
conference
at
the
palmer
house
and
it
truly
surpassed
my
expectations
i
had
no
idea
it
would
be
so
large
so
nice
and
with
so
many
amenities
i
also
didngt
realize
that
it
is
just
around
the
corner
from
milenium
park
and
the
art
institute
we
were
met
at
the
door
by
the
friendliest
staff
even
with
a
long
line
at
check
in
the
entire
process
was
about
minutes
we
enjoyed
the
room
with
the
up
to
date
tv
decent
size
bathroom
and
comfortable
bed
had
a
fantastic
breakfast
buffet
as
well
as
a
delicious
take
out
lunch
at
the
main
restaurant
paid
through
the
conference
which
seemed
quite
fair
considering
downtown
chicago
we
have
stayed
at
the
sofital
which
is
much
more
upscale
but
we
also
paid
over
there

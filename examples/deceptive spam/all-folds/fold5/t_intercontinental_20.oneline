i
was
attending
a
training
conference
in
chicago
and
opted
to
book
my
own
room
thru
one
of
the
online
discount
programs
rather
than
stay
at
the
rather
sterile
and
pedestrian
hotel
where
the
conference
was
being
held
i
booked
nights
at
the
intercontinental
and
was
pleased
with
the
elegance
and
convenient
location
an
easy
walk
to
the
conference
from
the
lobby
to
the
rooms
this
hotel
lives
up
to
itgs
storied
reputation
the
indoor
pool
seems
to
be
imported
from
the
set
of
a
busby
berkeley
movie
and
even
thog
i
was
there
for
a
conference
the
hotelgs
location
on
the
mag
mile
and
a
quick
jaunt
to
restaurants
and
theaters
made
for
a
very
pleasant
stay
at
a
very
affordable
price

we
stayed
in
the
ic
chicago
for
nights
from
dec
after
reading
the
reviews
on
trip
advisor
we
werent
disappointed
we
had
rooms
opposite
each
other
in
the
historic
tower
the
rooms
were
spacious
and
very
clean
with
good
views
towards
the
river
and
tribune
building
we
got
a
good
rate
on
the
rooms
but
did
not
have
breakfast
in
the
hotel
as
it
was
very
expensive
as
was
the
wifi
at
per
day
as
the
hotel
is
on
the
magnificent
mile
there
are
plenty
of
place
to
eat
including
for
breakfast
the
starbucks
in
the
lobby
was
a
hit
with
the
kids
very
handy
i
would
definitely
recommend
the
hotel

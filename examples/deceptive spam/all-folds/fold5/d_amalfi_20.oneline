i
recently
stayed
at
the
amalfi
hotel
chicago
in
chicago
illinois
i
must
say
that
staying
at
this
hotel
is
like
staying
at
a
high
end
hotel
for
celebrities
there
are
spa
packages
room
service
and
the
hotel
is
decorated
extremely
beautifully
i
would
recommend
this
hotel
to
anyone
that
is
looking
to
be
treated
like
a
star
they
take
reservations
and
also
have
a
great
restaurant
right
inside
of
the
building
whatever
you
need
they
will
accommodate
you
this
is
heaven
on
earth
i
would
recommend
anyone
to
stay
at
this
hotel
even
if
its
for
one
day
its
worth
it

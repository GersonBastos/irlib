my

i
spent
our
honeymoon
in
chicago
this
summer
during
this
time
we
stayed
that
the
hotel
allegro
i
knew
this
would
be
a
positive
experience
from
day
one
when
i
actually
booked
our
reservations
the
staff
was
very
knowledgeable
and
courteous
and
the
whole
process
was
quick
easy
and
painless
upon
actually
checking
in
the
day
of
our
honeymoon
the
customer
service
was
there
again
the
staff
again
made
us
feel
at
home
and
at
ease
the
rooms
were
beautiful
and
the
spa
service
is
excellent

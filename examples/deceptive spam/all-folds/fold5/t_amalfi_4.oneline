we
stayed
for
just
one
night
but
the
hotel
staff
was
extremely
friendly
and
polite
the
rooms
were
clean
and
large
the
decor
had
just
been
redone
the
best
perks
were
the
complimentary
continental
breakfast
on
each
floor
in
the
morning
and
the
free
cocktail
hour
with
premium
drinks
and
great
appetizers
at
night
we
got
a
great
rate
and
would
go
back
great
location
for
walking
around

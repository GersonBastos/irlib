everything
experienced
at
this
hotel
was
grand
the
hotel
itself
is
stunning
and
the

is
amazing
from
the
moment

walk
into
the
palmer
house
you
are
greeted
by
friendly
helpful
staff
the
rooms
are
out
of
this
world
with
no
detail
overlooked
comfortable
beds
amazing
bathrooms
and
breathtaking
views
of
chicago

you
are
looking
for
an
extravagant
hotel

windy
city

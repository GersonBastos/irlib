my
wife
and
i
stayed
here
for
a
weekend
and
we
absolutely
loved
it
the
atmosphere
was
very
chic
upscaleg
in
my
opinion
you
get
more
than
what
you
pay
for
with
the
brand
name
amenities
without
breaking
the
bank
my
wife
even
got
to
bring
along
her
dog
aka
man
i
would
definitely
stay
here
again
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
staying
in
the
chicago
area

i
have
stayed
at
the
amalfi
hotel
before
and
it
has
always
been
excellent
this
time
was
no
different
usually
i
book
direct
with
the
hotel
however
i
found
a
slightly
better
deal
booking
through
expedia
which
saved
about
the
staff
were
great
i
arrived
early
and
they
had
a
room
waiting
i
was
placed
on
the
top
floor
and
it
was
quiet
and
comfortable
overall
it
was
as
good
as
it
gets
i
will
definitely
continue
to
stay
here
when
igm
in
chicago
remember
the
hotel
is
close
to
everything
downtown
the
magnificent
mile
lots
of
restaurants
etc
everything
is
within
walking
distance

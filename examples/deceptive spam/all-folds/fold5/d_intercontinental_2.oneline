wow
i
have
been
to
many
hotels
as
a
business
man
and
have
seen
my
fair
share
of
garbage
dump
hotels
but
wow
this
hotel
was
great
the
staff
was
prompt
the
room
was
extremely
clean
and
everything
just
ran
like
a
well
oiled
machine
i
was
particularly
impressed
with
the
fact
that
the
front
desk
gives
out
free
toiletries
and
other
things
usually
i
have
to
pay
for
a
stupid
toothbrush
but
not
here
i
really
enjoyed
staying
at
intercontintental
i
was
very
worried
about
the
chicago
areags
reputation
of
bad
hotels
but
this
turned
out
just
great
next
time
my
boss
flies
me
out
to
chicago
i
know
where
i
am
staying

i
recently
had
the
pleasure
of
spending
three
nights
at
the
hotel
allegro
chicago
to
attend
a
corporate
meeting
to
say
the
rooms
at
this
beautifully
renovated
hotel
are
stylish
is
an
understatement
i
stayed
in
one
of
the
more
moderately
priced
rooms
yet
found
all
the
amenities
of
premium
rooms
at
other
hotels
my
room
was
spacious
and
furnished
in
a
retro
modern
style
a
fully
stocked
refreshment
center
wet
bar
and
lcd
hd
tv
were
amongst
the
standard
items
the
allegro
is
in
the
center
of
everything
the
chicago
loop
of
the
financial
district
the
chicago
theatre
district
great
shopping
on
slate
street
and
fine
dinning
is
available
adjacent
to
the
hotel
i
suggest
the
lunch
club
the
fitness
room
is
well
equipped
and
clean
the
professional
and
friendly
service
was
the
icing
on
the
cake
during
my
stay
at
the
allegro
my
next
visit
to
the
chicago
area
will
definitely
include
a
stay
at
the
hotel
allegro
chicago

my
husband
and
i
recently
chose
the
palmer
house
hilton
for
a
rare
couplegs
getaway
from
our
usual
life
and
an
escape
it
truly
provided
there
is
something
to
be
said
for
all
the
modern
amenities
combined
with
an
aesthetic
drawn
from
a
grander
and
more
luxurious
time
let
alone
with
ever
elusive
accessibility
for
a
wheelchair
user
a
bonus
was
that
we
did
not
need
to
feel
like
we
must
lug
half
our
usual
household
with
us
because
things
like
alarm
clocks
hairdryers
and
ironing
boards
were
already
there
electronic
media
even
available
for
rent
with
a
comfortable
bed
control
over
how
the
room
felt
no
need
to
search
elsewhere
for
coffee
and
excellent
room
service
at
our
beck
and
call
we
had
to
remind
ourselves
that
we
had
planned
to
leave
our
room
to
take
advantage
of
all
the
chicago
culture
in
close
proximity
too
often
a
hotel
is
an
overpriced
way
to
get
out
of
making
your
own
bed
in
the
morning
but
the
hilton
was
a
true
vacation
thank
you

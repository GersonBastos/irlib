very
beautiful
hotel
with
a
wonderful
view
the
dinning
selection
is
one
of
the
best
i
have
seen
in
chicago
i
have
stayed
many
places
downtown
chicago
and
nothing
matches
this
i
am
a
single
mother
with
two
children
and
the
concept
of
having
a
day
care
facility
on
site
is
just
not
great
for
me
but
for
my
children
as
well
the
shopping
area
has
great
selections
right
outside
of
the
doors
the
biggest
thing
that
i
have
to
say
is
that
the
customer
service
was
great
with
everything
that
i
needed
i
give
the
hotel
a
out
of

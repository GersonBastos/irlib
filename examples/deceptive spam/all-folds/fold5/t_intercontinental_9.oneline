we
stayed
here
through
hotwire
and
got
an
amazingly
low
rate
some
odd
dollars
nightly
for
a
night
stay
last
may
the
room
they
had
us
in
was
small
and
had
no
view
of
anything
except
the
wall
of
the
other
part
of
the
hotel
but
it
was
very
clean
tastefully
decorated
and
cozy
we
had
a
great
vacation
walking
all
over
town
until
we
ended
up
near
the
planetarium
which
was
where
we
then
turned
around
and
saw
the
skyline
of
chicago
and
were
just
wow
so
anyway
the
hotel
is
great
the
service
was
great
the
room
was
very
nice
i
would
recommend
this
hotel
to
anyone
though
i
work
at
the
front
desk
of
a
hotel
myself
and
the
previous
persongs
comment
about
how
she
wasngt
able
to
get
adjoining
rooms
well
internet
sites
dongt
guarantee
things
like
that
anyway
yougve
got
to
call
the
hotel
direct
and
verify
things
like
that
theregs
a
note
about
that
on
internet
sites
as
well
no
room
type
location
is
guaranteed
stars
out
of
for
this
hotel

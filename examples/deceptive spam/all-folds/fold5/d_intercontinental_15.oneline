the
intercontinental
hotel
is
truly
a
hidden
treasure
nestled
deep
in
sky
scraping
steel
epicenter
of
downtown
chicago
the
hotel
is
a
taste
of
both
modern
day
luxury
and
old
time
charm
from
the
tiled
indoor
pool
surrounded
by
high
romanesque
arching
ceilings
to
the
rich
mahogany
furniture
and
lace
curtains
in
the
suites
the
intercontinental
was
built
to
satisfy
the
taste
of
even
the
most
hardened
traveler
book
well
in
advance
as
it
is
one
of
the
most
sought
after
retreats
in
all
of
chicago

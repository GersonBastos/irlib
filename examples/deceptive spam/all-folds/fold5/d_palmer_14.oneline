if
anyone
is
traveling
to
chicago
i
would
strongly
recommend
the
palmer
house
hilton
i
have
spent
two
nights
in
this
hotel
during
a
recent
business
trip
and
i
was
impressed
by
the
elegant
feel
and
look
of
the
hotel
i
had
a
guest
room
with
a
double
bed
at
the
first
sight
the
room
had
perfect
decor
the
double
bed
looked
comfy
and
cozy
it
wasngt
just
a
room
because
it
also
came
with
high
speed
internet
and
personalized
listening
options
which
were
great
features
for
a
tired
traveler
like
me
since
i
was
in
a
hurry
in
my
two
day
stay
i
didngt
have
time
to
wander
around
the
town
for
food
it
wasngt
a
problem
because
the
hotel
offered
a
few
places
to
dine
or
simply
for
snacks
the
good
thing
is
that
their
bar
and
lounge
opened
late
at
night
i
can
assure
you
that
they
had
great
quality
food
and
drinks
if
you
are
just
touring
the
city
the
hotel
is
quite
close
to
parks
museum
and
a
lot
of
shopping
places
if
you
just
need
a
place
to
stay
the
view
from
the
hotel
was
pretty
good
as
well
among
all
the
hotels
i
have
spent
time
in
the
palmer
house
hilton
tops
the
list

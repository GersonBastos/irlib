was
slated
for
two
nights
in
chicago
june
i
could
onyl
get
the
intercon
for
both
nights
i
booked
a
handicapped
room
since
that
was
they
had
left
after
reading
other
reviews
of
the
property
i
decided
to
move
it
from
two
nights
to
one
and
stay
the
second
night
at
the
hotel
monaco
of
course
upon
check
in
i
was
given
a
suite
nice
room
great
linens
clean
bathroom
and
very
quiet
parking
is
really
high
i
understand
some
peopel
saying
the
rooms
need
to
be
updated
but
everything
was
clean
and
worked
well
at
ost
the
rooms
were
a
bit
dark
i
had
a
late
night
drink
at
the
bar
which
was
reasonably
priced
i
did
not
eat
there
but
the
menu
seemed
pretty
good
albeit
with
the
typical
hotel
mark
ups
to
be
expected
in
all
i
thought
the
place
was
everything
i
needed
and
was
very
happy
with
the
room
the
staff
the
linens
and
the
housekeeping
much
better
than
others
have
indicated

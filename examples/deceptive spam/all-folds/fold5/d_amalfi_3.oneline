i
recently
stayed
at
the
amalfi
chicago
with
my
wife
on
a
business
trip
we
decided
to
combine
business
with
pleasure
and
made
a
long
weekend
out
of
our
stay
after
business
was
concluded
we
enjoyed
the
luxurious
in
room
spa
service
and
stayed
in
the
superb
one
bedroom
suite
with
incomparable
views
of
the
surrounding
city
the
individualized
attention
from
check
in
to
reservations
was
exceptional
and
better
than
what
we
usually
receive
from
concierge
service
the
amalfi
actually
delivered
what
they
promised
and
more
our
weekend
was
more
relaxing
and
enjoyable
due
to
the
excellent
training
of
the
staff
and
the
amenities
offered
on
site
the
hotelgs
design
is
modern
and
sophisticated
with
the
decor
being
a
delight
to
the
senses
lots
of
color
and
clean
lines
made
a
great
impression
and
felt
both
modern
and
comfortable
breakfast
is
served
on
each
floor
or
in
room
and
my
wife
especially
appreciated
the
availability
of
the
fresh
fruit
and
yogurt
being
of
european
descent
i
enjoyed
the
croissants
whole
grain
muffins
real
butter
and
marmalade
we
also
brought
along
our
standard
poodle
sterling
and
the
amalfi
is
one
of
the
few
luxury
hotels
that
allow
for
pet
accommodations
and
understand
that
your
pet
is
part
of
the
family
we
purchased
the
pet
pamper
package
and
this
allowed
sterling
to
have
his
days
while
we
had
ours
and
we
reunited
in
the
evenings
sterling
slept
in
our
room
as
usual
at
the
foot
of
our
bed
and
this
contributed
to
our
feeling
at
home
while
away
for
pet
lovers
this
is
a
big
plus
finally
transportation
to
and
from
our
corporate
jet
was
arranged
with
ease
by
the
hotel
so
we
did
not
bring
an
assistant
with
us
on
this
trip
to
handle
these
arrangements
as
is
normal
this
allowed
us
a
bit
more
privacy
and
it
is
scarce
for
us
to
be
able
to
do
this
another
appreciated
bonus
of
our
stay
thank
you
amalfi
for
a
superb
experience

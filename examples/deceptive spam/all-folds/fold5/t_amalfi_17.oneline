this
was
our
second
time
staying
here
we
were
very
much
looking
forward
to
our
weekend
at
the
amalfi
based
on
how
well
the
first
stay
was
it
turned
out
better
than
our
anticipation
the
beds
are
very
comfortable
headed
showers
with
a
large
bathroom
the
hotel
is
also
pleasantly
quiet
and
easy
to
check
in
and
out
our
room
was
near
the
exercise
room
which
helped
motivate
us
to
get
in
an
hour
morning
workout
then
we
were
able
to
grab
some
complimentary
fruit
pastries
juice
and
coffee
on
our
floor
breakfast
is
on
every
floor
no
great
view
from
our
room
but
i
dongt
think
there
are
great
views
from
most
any
room
since
it
is
only
floors
we
didngt
need
to
drive
take
a
cab
or
jump
on
the
l
the
whole
weekend
since
the
hotel
is
centrally
located
we
easily
walked
to
bars
blues
clubs
restaurants
the
hancock
tower
the
loop
and
the
waterfront
all
from
our
hotel
the
highlight
of
the
hotel
was
the
complimentary
happy
hour
free
top
shelf
drinks
and
wonderful
meats
cheeses
peppers
and
breads
this
ran
from
to
and
was
a
great
warm
up
to
a
nice
dinner
this
alone
saved
us
a
bundle
in
money
that
would
of
been
spent
eating
and
drinking
out
in
the
evening
and
an
extra
money
saving
tip
park
at
the
self
park
lot
blocks
west
of
the
hotel
on
kinzie
its
per
night
during
the
week
and
only
per
night
on
the
weekends
i
think
the
hotel
charges
to
per
night
to
park

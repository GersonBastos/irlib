the
palmer
house
hilton
hotel
has
it
all
for
the
business
and
leisure
traveler
out
there
i
stayed
at
this
hotel
on
business
and
all
i
can
say
is
wow
one
of
the
main
things
that
i
liked
about
the
hotel
was
the
indoor
pool
i
loved
being
able
to
go
swimming
even
though
it
was
december
and
degrees
outside
also
the
hotel
does
offer
wireless
in
the
room
and
this
really
came
in
handy
for
me
to
keep
up
with
my
work
after
my
meetings
i
dined
at
lockwood
restaurant
and
bar
and
the
food
was
amazing
for
a
hotel
one
thing
that
was
a
minor
negative
is
that
pets
are
allowed
and
my
original
room
was
next
door
to
a
barking
dog
but
the
hotel
staff
was
fantastic
as
switched
up
my
room
so
i
didngt
have
to
deal
with
that
all
in
all
this
hotel
was
fantastic
and
i
look
forward
to
the
next
time
i
get
to
stay
here

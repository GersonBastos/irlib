recently
i
traveled
to
chicago
for
business
i
was
treated
to
a
stay
at
the
intercontinental
chicago
by
my
employer
it
truly
says
something
about
your
company
when
they
are
willing
to
go
the
extra
mile
to
make
time
away
from
family
and
friends
as
comfortable
and
as
relaxing
as
possible
for
you
i
was
greeted
by
a
series
of
smiling
faces
that
were
employed
at
the
hotel
and
all
were
eager
to
help
i
checked
in
at
the
amazingly
lavish
lobby
and
was
escorted
by
hotel
staff
who
assisted
me
with
my
bags
up
to
my
room
my
room
was
dripping
with
taste
the
stylish
room
was
only
made
more
accommodating
by
the
amenities
it
offered
with
a
mini
bar
large
flat
screen
television
and
an
entire
home
office
setup
i
barely
had
to
leave
the
room
why
would
i
want
to
with
the
amazing
views
of
the
lake
and
entire
city
what
an
amazing
experience
i
had
and
i
will
gladly
come
back

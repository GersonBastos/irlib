my
husband
and
i
visited
this
hotel
on
our
way
home
from
our
honeymoon
itgs
a
very
nice
hotel
but
the
valet
parking
is
very
expensive
per
night
was
rather
high
so
we
opted
to
park
our
own
car
the
pool
was
very
nice
and
the
water
was
warm
the
front
desk
was
very
nice
and
helpful
if
i
ever
visited
chicago
again
i
would
stay
there

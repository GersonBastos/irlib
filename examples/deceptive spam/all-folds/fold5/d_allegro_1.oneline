hotel
allegro
chicago
is
a
beautiful
place
i
was
originally
dreading
being
in
chicago
due
to
the
fact
it
was
all
business
and
no
play
but
as
soon
as
i
saw
the
inside
of
the
hotel
i
was
stunned
i
wasngt
expecting
to
stay
at
a
place
that
made
business
trip
feel
like
a
get
away
vacation
the
service
there
was
amazing
everybody
was
very
friendly
when
i
saw
my
room
once
again
my
jaw
almost
dropped
the
room
was
fit
for
a
king
the
designs
on
the
wall
were
so
elegant
the
beds
were
extraordinarily
comfy
i
think
for
my
next
business
trip
i
am
going
to
bring
my
wife
and
kids
with
me
i
give
this
kimpton
hotel

the
hotel
allegro
in
chicago
is
understated
luxury
i
love
the
minimalist
decor
and
the
linens
were
quality
and
exquisite
you
cangt
beat
the
location
either
itgs
located
in
the
heart
of
the
theatre
district
walking
distance
to
all
the
great
restaurants
in
chicago
they
also
offer
an
in
room
spa
service
which
is
pure
decadence
i
chose
to
indulge
in
the
eucalyptus
mani
pedi
it
was
by
far
the
priciest
manicure
and
pedicure
i
have
had
in
my
life
dollars
but
it
was
a
wonderful
experience
the
eucalyptus
treatments
left
my
hands
and
feet
feeling
so
soft
yet
refreshed
at
the
same
time
i
highly
recommend
this
hotel
if
you
want
to
experience
the
finer
thingsthis
gorgeous
city
has
to
offer

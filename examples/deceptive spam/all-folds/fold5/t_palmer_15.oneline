we
stayed
at
the
palmer
house
hilton
in
early
december
we
stay
there
that
weekend
every
december
and
we
think
it
is
the
best
location
in
the
city
for
us
we
like
state
street
better
than
michigan
avenue
and
the
palmer
house
is
right
there
we
stayed
in
the
towers
in
a
room
with
two
double
beds
and
baths
the
room
was
not
huge
but
very
comfortable
the
towers
area
was
recently
refurbished
and
it
shows
the
lobby
is
beautiful
with
plasma
screen
tvs
on
the
walls
comfortable
chairs
and
tables
and
a
seperate
room
for
the
food
drinks
there
is
a
continental
breakfast
in
the
morning
appetizers
during
cocktail
hour
and
cookies
are
laid
out
until
the
room
closes
there
is
a
fridge
stocked
with
soft
drinks
water
and
juice
that
are
yours
for
the
taking
we
were
very
pleased
with
the
upgraded
towers
everyone
should
check
it
out

this
hotel
was
great
in
a
great
area
right
downtown
and
close
to
everything
the
daily
happy
hour
had
great
food
wine
and
premium
liquors
the
free
breakfast
was
even
better
actually
i
believe
everything
was
included
breakfast
happy
hour
business
center
wifi
our
room
was
a
king
size
facing
the
back
of
the
building
really
clean
new
and
comfortable
small
touches
such
as
books
and
cds
to
enjoy
made
the
room
feel
less
like
a
hotel
would
highly
recommend

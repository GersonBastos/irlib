i
was
going
to
chicago
last
month
and
wanted
a
nice
hotel
that
was
close
to
restaurants
and
shops
i
did
some
research
and
believed
the
intercontinental
would
suit
my
needs
i
sure
was
not
disappointed
by
my
decision
this
hotel
lots
of
historic
charm
despite
being
a
larger
hotel
the
service
was
top
shelf
the
rooms
while
not
large
by
any
means
were
extremely
well
appointed
and
very
comfortable
my
kids
loved
the
big
swimming
pool
that
the
hotel
offered
as
for
me
i
was
more
impressed
with
the
location
to
the
magnificent
mile
the
hotel
also
has
a
nice
restaurant
on
site
the
food
was
very
good
and
just
like
the
hotel
itself
the
restaurant
provided
perfect
customer
service
dollar
for
dollar
the
intercontinental
in
chicago
is
a
great
deal
and
i
will
be
staying
there
again

the
amalfi
hotel

one
of
the
best
experiences

had
it
definitely
felt
as
comfortable
as
home
with
the
all
the
luxuriance
of
a
five
star
establishment
i
had
forgotten
my
favorite
cd
that
puts
me
to
sleep
each
night
when
mentioning
this
in
front
of
the
front
desk
clerk
she
told
me
that
they
have
a
huge
collection
of
cdgs
available
for
guests
low
and
behold
they
had
my
favorite
cd
also
my
laptop
was
not
cooperating
come
to
find
out
they
offer
every
guest
full
access
to
their
amazing
and
fully
functional
business
center
from
now

when
visiting
chicago

only
be
staying

palmer
house
hilton
last
month
to
celebrate
our
anniversary
what
a
wonderful
hotel
we
had
such
a
great
weekend
largely
thanks
to
the
palmer
house
every
amenity
we
could
want
was
right
there
at
the
hotel
at
our
fingertips
and
the
location
is
perfect
right
in
downtown
chicago
we
stayed
in
one
of
their
one
bedroom
king
suites
it
was
exquisite
so
elegant
and
beautiful
it
was
easily
the
most
luxurious
suite
we
have
ever
stayed
in
the
service
was
impeccable
every
employee
we
encountered
was
both
pleasant
and
eager
to
accomodate
any
need
we
expressed
we
had
our
anniversary
dinner
at
the
lockwood
restaurant
in
the
hotel
it
was
delicious
we
will
definitely
return
to
the
palmer
house
hilton
for
our
next
special
weekend
getaway

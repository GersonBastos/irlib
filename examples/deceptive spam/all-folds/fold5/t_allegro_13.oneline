i
stayed
at
the
allegro
in
july
for
nights
for
a
business
trip
the
room
was
spotlessly
clean
and
the
bed
was
great
i
had
read
reviews
that
said
the
bathrooms
were
tiny
but
ours
was
perfectly
fine
with
funky
fun
doors
the
decor
is
a
lot
of
fun
we
were
on
the
floor
and
there
was
absolutely
no
street
noise
the
front
desk
staff
was
very
friendly
and
before
we
even
made
it
to
the
desk
a
lovely
man
took
our
bags
and
brought
them
up
to
our
room
within
moments
of
our
arrival
we
were
within
walking
distance
to
all
the
theaters
and
even
walked
one
night
all
the
way
to
navy
pier
for
people
who
were
upset
about
no
free
coffee
theregs
a
dunkin
donuts
about
a
block
away
i
definitely
recommend
this
hotel

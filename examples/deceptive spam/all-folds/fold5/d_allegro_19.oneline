if
you
are
traveling
to
chicago
and
need
a
place
to
stay
i
highly
recommend
the
hotel
allegro
chicago
it
was
visiting
time
visiting
chicago
for
the
first
time
on
a
business
trip
and
a
friend
referred
me
to
the
hotel
allegro
he
said
they
were
pet
friendly
which
was
a
huge
plus
this
is
because
i
hate
leaving
my
kitten
muffin
with
a
pet
sitter
every
time
i
travel
for
business
upon
my
arrival
i
was
met
with
friendly
valet
who
treated
me
like
i
was
the
only
customer
who
mattered
i
walked
in
and
saw
a
hotel
like
no
other
i
have
seen
before
or
after
the
lobby
was
decorated
with
modern
furniture
and
paintings
and
looked
like
a
place
i
could
relax
in
after
i
had
entered
and
checked
in
i
saw
the
staircase
which
looked
like
a
testament
to
the
staircase
in
the
titanic
frankly
i
was
amazed
and
i
had
not
even
entered
my
room
yet
my
room
was
a
queen
deluxe
room
and
it
was
amazing
the
bed
had
a
blue
headboard
which
i
have
never
seen
before
and
the
colors
worked
together
so
well
i
seriously
contemplated
living
there
the
room
service
was
exceptional
and
promptly
brought
the
food
i
ordered
later
i
wanted
to
get
a
drink
and
i
enjoyed
it
at
the
bar
which
is
conveniently
located
adjacent
to
the
hotel
these
are
the
specifics
of
my
stay
but
there
is
much
more
to
be
experienced
that
i
did
not
mention
if
you
visit
the
hotel
allegro
in
summary
they
allow
pets
the
service
is
amazing
the
decoration
superb
and
it
is
conveniently
situated
next
to
dining
establishments
what
more
could
a
person
ask
for

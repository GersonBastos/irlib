i
have
to
admit
i
was
a
little
leery
about
visiting
chicago
due
to
my
mild
agoraphobia
but
after
a
family
member
reserved
a
room
at
the
hotel
allegro
chicago
my
fears
were
slightly
assuaged
a
few
friends
of
mine
had
stayed
in
this
hotel
before
and
had
nothing
but
positive
things
to
say
with
this
new
found
optimism
in
mind
i
went
forward
on
my
journey
in
confidence
i
have
to
say
i
was
not
let
down
from
the
moment
i
stepped
into
the
lobby
i
felt
at
home
the
concierge
called
bellboys
to
move
our
luggage
from
the
taxi
to
our
rooms
and
the
check
in
process
was
fast
and
efficient
the
rooms
themselves
are
incredibly
homey
feeling
less
like
a
hotel
room
and
more
like
the
guest
room
at
a
millionairegs
mansion
the
high
comfort
level
coupled
with
prompt
service
when
requesting
items
such
as
extra
pillows
and
towels
really
helped
alleviate
my
apprehensions
about
staying
in
chicago
and
provided
a
secure
place
to
stay
at
night
or
whenever
i
did
not
feel
like
participating
with
the
group
of
course
the
rooms
are
second
only
to
the
overall
feel
of
the
hotel
i
found
myself
spending
less
of
my
downtime
in
my
room
and
more
of
it
wandering
around
the
building
overall
itgs
very
cozy
and
has
a
certain
old
world
feeling
to
it
once
again
lending
to
it
feeling
less
like
a
hotel
and
more
like
a
mansion
at
times
it
was
never
overwhelmingly
crowded
and
the
people
i
did
encounter
were
incredibly
friendly
yet
not
intrusive
i
dongt
usually
enjoy
staying
in
hotels
but
i
love
the
allegro
chicago

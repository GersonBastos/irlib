i
went
here
with
the
family
including
our
dog
marley
they
are
very
pet
friendly
we
really
enjoyed
it
this
place
is
huge
with
over
rooms
and
suites
and
is
in
the
center
of
downtown
close
to
shopping
and
entertainment
it
also
seems
that
it
would
be
a
great
place
to
have
a
wedding
or
to
host
an
event
i
will
definately
be
coming
back
next
time
i
need
to
come
to
chicago
definately
a
fine
four
star
hotel

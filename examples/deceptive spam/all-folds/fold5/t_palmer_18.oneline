we
just
returned
from
a
weekend
at
the
palmer
house
we
normally
stay
north
on
the
mag
mile
but
wanted
to
be
closer
to
soldiergs
stadium
and
the
art
insitiute
this
time
we
were
able
to
upgrade
to
a
suite
upon
arrival
at
half
the
price
that
we
paid
for
a
regular
room
at
the
four
seasons
two
weeks
earlier
what
a
suite
it
was
huge
the
basic
living
room
dining
room
and
kitchen
wet
bar
area
was
one
large
room
up
to
three
additional
bedrooms
can
be
added
by
the
use
of
connecting
doors
all
rooms
were
spotlessly
clean
they
even
smelled
good
lovely
soaps
robes
etc
lots
of
large
closets
the
bathrooms
were
older
but
well
maintained
much
better
than
the
ones
at
the
four
seasons
the
furniture
was
nice
but
worn
in
some
spots
the
beds
and
linens
were
excellent
room
service
was
fast
the
food
and
service
were
great
the
pool
and
workout
areas
were
clean
and
well
maintained
we
had
one
small
problem
with
a
burned
out
lightbulb
in
one
of
the
lamps
maintaince
arrived
quickly
with
a
new
bulb
they
wouldngt
allow
me
to
tip
them
check
in
was
somewhat
slow
as
the
hotel
has
been
sold
out
for
several
weeks
this
is
a
very
large
hotel
so
they
have
to
move
a
lot
of
people
and
rooms
also
the
hotel
does
not
have
views
as
it
is
configured
like
an
e
all
in
all
the
palmer
house
is
a
good
value
for
the
money

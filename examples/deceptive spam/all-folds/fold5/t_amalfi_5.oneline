i
decided
to
book
at
the
amalfi
after
cancelling
a
reservation
for
a
different
hotel
after
reading
their
reviews
on
ta
i
was
blown
away
by
the
reviews
for
the
amalfi
on
ta
and
decided
to
check
it
out
i
was
able
to
secure
a
great
price
on
the
hotel
room
and
i
was
not
disappointed
i
asked
to
be
put
in
a
quiet
room
because
i
was
having
an
interview
the
next
day
the
room
was
very
quiet
and
in
a
great
location
but
my
only
complaint
was
that
it
was
right
next
to
the
fitness
center
and
i
could
hear
people
running
on
the
treadmill
during
the
day
however
it
quieted
down
at
night
and
i
could
not
hear
anything
the
rooms
were
enormous
for
chicago
and
i
was
pleased
the
hotel
provided
free
breakfast
which
was
good
free
internet
and
free
gym
access
the
hotel
is
only
a
few
blocks
from
the
magnificient
mile
and
i
walked
there
everyday
to
do
shopping
i
have
to
say
that
the
doorman
is
truly
a
gem
and
is
very
friendly
i
wish
that
their
front
desk
staff
were
as
friendly
as
he
was
all
in
all
i
plan
to
stay
at
the
amalfi
anytime
i
visit
chicago
in
the
future

the
palmer
house
hlton
hotel
has
to
be
the
nicest
hotel
i
have
stayed
at
in
chicago
i
went
to
chicago
on
a
business
trip
for
a
meeting
when
i
arrived
once
i
walked
in
the
lobby
was
beautiful
i
couldngt
hardly
wait
to
see
my
room
the
rooms
were
just
as
nice
the
bathroom
was
immaculate
we
had
a
meeting
in
the
clark
meeting
room
even
that
was
nice
i
wanted
to
take
a
tour
of
the
hotel
itself
i
was
there
for
about
days
and
because
of
how
convenient
the
hotel
was
to
a
lot
of
major
attractions
like
grant
park
lake
michigan
mag
mile
which
is
a
shopping
heaven
and
the
navy
pier
it
never
really
like
the
normal
stressed
out
meetings
i
love
chicago
and
i
now
have
a
new
favorite
hotel
to
stay
at
while
igm
in
town

the
pleasure
of

gave
a
good
first
impression

was
a
very
clean
with
a
modern
designergs
feel
and
the
customer
service
was
great
i
proceeded
to
the
counter
to
check
in
and
within
minutes
i
had
the
key
to
my
room
i
was
told
to
check
out
the
infamous
restaurant
but
i
was
tired
from
my
flight
i
checked
into
my
room
the
room
was
great

had
to

quick
and
painless

had
a
good
night
sleep
and
early

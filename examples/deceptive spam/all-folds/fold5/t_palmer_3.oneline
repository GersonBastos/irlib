i
stayed
at
the
palmer
house
for
on
a
corporate
rate
the
bed
was
excellent
the
linens
towels
were
top
of
the
line
i
did
not
find
my
room
shabby
as
other
reviewers
noted
the
palmer
house
is
over
years
old
rooms
have
older
woodwork
and
classic
furnitureg
i
think
that
lends
to
the
ambience
of
the
place
it
is
expensive
and
igm
not
sure
igd
stay
there
if
my
company
werengt
picking
up
the
tab
but
the
hotel
itself
is
still
awe
inspiring

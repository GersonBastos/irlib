we
have
stayed
here
several
times
and
have
always
found
it
to
be
clean
with
comfortable
beds
we
were
given
a
choice
of
breakfast
or
free
cocktails
which
we
thought
was
a
nice
touch
our
room
was
small
but
adequate
location
was
great
close
to
the
l
trains
and
also
close
to
the
train
station
as
we
always
walk
from
union
station

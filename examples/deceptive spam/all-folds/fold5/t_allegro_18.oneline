this

reasonable
for
downtown
chicago
an
older
hotel
with
a
great
reno
a
bit
over
the
top
design
but
still
very
lovely
and
charming
clean
rooms
and
very
friendly
staff
theygre
also
amazingly
pet
friendly
they
welcomed
our
mastiff
cross
with
a
gift
bag
treats
and
directions
to
an
off
leash
area
and
even
had
a
cute
blackboard
with

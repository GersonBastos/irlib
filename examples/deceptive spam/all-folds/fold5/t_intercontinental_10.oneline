i
stayed
at
the
intercontinental
during
the
last
weekend
in
september
for
a
pleasure
trip
the
intercontinental
was
in
a
great
location
and
the
staff
was
excellent
the
room
was
clean
and
comfortable
and
came
equipped
with
a
new
lg
flat
panel
tv
had
breakfast
at
zest
hotel
restaurant
a
bit
pricey
but
decent
if
you
want
a
buffet
the
hotel
is
in
walking
distance
to
millenium
park
museums
and
the
aquarium
there
is
also
a
lot
of
shopping
window
shopping
is
best
though
considering
the
sales
tax
is
and
possibly
raising
to
great
stay
i
highly
recommend
it
and
would
stay
there
again

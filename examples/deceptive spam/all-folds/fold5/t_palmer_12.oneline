just
returned
from
a
week
in
chicago
with
the
family
this
hotel
was
perfect
for
us
location
is
great
kids
loved
the
pool
as
a
place
to
wind
down
after
a
day
of
museums
touring
ball
games
etc
we
checked
in
through
hilton
honors
desk
as
opposed
to
the
regular
check
in
line
even
though
our
reservations
were
through
priceline
at
a
reduced
rate
they
gave
us
a
pick
of
the
the
rooms
the
room
had
a
large
closet
which
helped
with
the
amount
of
gear
we
had
with
us
used
valet
parking
which
was
hasselfree
we
had
a
great
experience
and
would
stay
there
again

after
reading
some
of
the
most
recent
reviews
igm
really
perplexed
i
didngt
know
what
to
expect
but
i
was
most
pleasantly
surprised
just
as
all
the
past
reviews
both
negative
and
positive
have
stated
you
cangt
beat
the
location
of
this
hotel
itgs
perfect
we
had
a
big
spacious
room
in
the
old
tower
we
avoided
the
expensive
pitfalls
of
the
hotel
extras
such
as
bottled
water
and
items
in
the
room
fridge
the
beds
were
great
the
rooms
were
kept
clean
and
the
staff
was
very
friendly
great
martinis
in
the
hotel
bar
i
really
cangt
understand
the
negative
reviews
i
know
you
cangt
please
everyone
but
in
some
cases
i
simply
dongt
believe
their
claims
igve
traveled
a
lot
and
have
stayed
in
plenty
of
hotels
this
is
a
great
hotel

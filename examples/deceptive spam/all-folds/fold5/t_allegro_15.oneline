my
husband
and
i
stayed
at
the
hotel
allegro
in
march
we
had
a
great
time
we
were
upgraded
to
a
suite
and
enjoyed
the
jacuzzi
tub
with
mr
bubbles
animal
print
robes
and
a
luxurious
king
sized
bed
the
suite
was
very
nice
and
we
had
no
problem
with
noise
from
other
rooms
or
from
the
street
it
was
very
boutiquey
and
the
lobby
was
lovely
we
enjoyed
the
complementary
wine
hour
the
staff
was
attentive
and
our
stay
in
this
kimpton
hotel
made
our
first
time
trip
to
chicago
memorable
we
would
return
here

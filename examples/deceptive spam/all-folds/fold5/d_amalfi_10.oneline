my
friend
and
i
visited
amalfi
hotel
last
week
when
we
were
in
chicago
and
found
it
to
be
a
great
place
very
sophisticated
and
luxurious
with
lots
of
attention
to
detail
in
the
decor
and
wonderful
customer
service
the
beds
were
comfortable
the
room
service
was
great
as
was
the
gym
i
fully
enjoyed
the
views
from
the
hotel
room
so
beautiful
at
night
the
city
scape
and
in
the
morning
the
free
continental
breakfast
was
delicious
it
was
a
wonderful
experience
being
at
the
amalfi
hotel
in
chicago
i
am
eager
to
visit
there
again

this
was
my
first
time
in
chicago
and
i
tell
you
they
really
made
me
feel
like
a
million
bucks
i
took
a
taxi
straight
from
the
airport
and
was
greeted
at
the
door
by
a
kind
gentlemen
who
offered
to
help
me
with
my
luggage
and
assisted
me
to
the
check
in
counter
i
made
my
way
up
to
my
room
which
was
spectacularly
bright
and
well
lit
then
i
ordered
some
food
all
in
all
the
food
was
delicious
and
the
staff
were
fantastic
if
i
didngt
have
such
a
short
stay
in
chicago
i
would
have
stayed
in
my
hotel
room
all
day

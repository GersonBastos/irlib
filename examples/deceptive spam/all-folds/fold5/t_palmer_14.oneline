my
wife
and
i
redeemed
some
of
my
hilton
reward
points
to
stay
a
few
nights
at
the
palmer
house
the
hotel
is
absolutely
beautiful
from
the
moment
you
walk
into
the
lobby
you
can
tell
that
this
place
is
nice
as
we
were
diamond
members
we
got
upgraded
to
a
suite
which
was
great
because
we
were
provided
access
to
their
executive
lounge
free
food
drinks
the
service
was
excellent
and
the
location
of
the
hotel
is
within
walking
distance
of
many
sights
on
the
south
side
of
chicago
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
hotel
to
anyone
interested
in
coming
to
chicago

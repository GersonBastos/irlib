the
allegro
in
downtown
chicago
is
a
great
stay
part
of
the
kimpton
group
boutique
hotels
the
allegro
offers
a
classy
stay
in
a
beautiful
room
for
a
moterate
price
they
offer
complimentary
and
decent
wine
gratis
in
the
late
afternoon
and
the
hotel
allows
you
access
to
everything
the
loop
has
to
offer
in
this
remarkable
city
i
would
recommend
parking
outside
of
the
downtown
area
and
taking
the
gel'
into
the
loop
which
leaves
you
about
minutes
from
the
hotel
otherwise
you
are
looking
at
hefty
parking
fees
for
a
car
you
dont
need
in
this
part
of
the
city
the
rooms
are
small
but
beautifully
done
with
great
colors
comfortable
beds
and
in
my
case
great
views
if
you
go
to
kimpton
group
website
and
sign
up
for
specials
you
will
be
alerted
to
great
rates
on
certain
days
kimpton
does
a
great
job
and
their
properties
are
class
acts

a
few
nights
ago
i
stayed
at
the
hotel
allegro
in
the
theater
district
of
chicago
igd
heard
some
amazing
things
about
the
great
food
and
how
friendly
the
staff
were
upon
arrival
the
service
at
the
front
desk
and
the
bellman
was
fantastic
they
treated
me
as
if
i
stayed
there
all
the
time
the
rooms
were
cozy
with
very
comfortable
beds
that
helped
me
sleep
through
my
jet
lag
i
ordered
breakfast
the
next
morning
and
had
room
service
bring
it
up
the
meal
was
brought
up
only
a
few
minutes
after
ordering
and
was
delicious
i
would
recommend
these
accommodations
for
anyone
traveling
or
any
families
staying
in
chicago
as
the
rooms
were
very
reasonably
priced
and
is
a
short
distance
to
lots
of
great
sites
next
time
i
come
through
chicago
i
will
definitely
be
staying
here

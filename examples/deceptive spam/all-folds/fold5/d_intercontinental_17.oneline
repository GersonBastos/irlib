i
am
so
glad
i
decided
to
stay
at
the
intercontinental
chicago
for
my
first
trip
to
the
city
the
staff
is
very
attentive
i
felt
like
i
was
the
only
person
they
had
to
take
care
of
the
location
is
great
right
on
the
magnificent
mile
and
so
close
to
major
attractions
my
suite
was
well
appointed
and
very
clean
i
even
looked
behind
some
furniture
for
dust
and
couldngt
find
any
the
hotel
is
very
luxurious
the
sheets
and
towels
were
very
soft
and
the
bed
very
comfortable
the
next
time
i
travel
to
chicago
i
will
definitely
stay
at
the
intercontinental
again

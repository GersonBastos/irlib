i
was
visiting
chicago
for
a
christening
with
my
fiance
i
was
impressed
with
this
hotel
from
the
moment
i
checked
in
the
lobby
was
exceptionally
modern
with
color
and
furnishings
front
desk
staff
was
pleasant
and
helpful
especially
susan
who
quickly
suggested
and
reserved
a
table
for
us
at
keefergs
steakhouse
for
a
late
dinner
the
room
itself
was
fabulous

comfortable

sized
bed
dual
head
shower
breathtakingly
beautiful
views
of
the
city
i
couldngt
ask
for
more
after
a
great
nights
sleep
we
awoke
to
a
great
free
breakfast
right
outside
our
room
next
we
enjoyed
a
couplegs
massage
and
i
was
treated
to
a
facial
as
my
fiance
took
a
short
run
through
the
city
after
a
day
full
of
shopping
we
retired
to
our
room
and
ordered
room
service
that
was
on
time
and
delicious

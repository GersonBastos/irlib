the
only
minus
for
this
hotel
is
they
do
not
provide
the
free
morning
coffee
at
all
the
other
kimpton
hotels
it
was
a
great
place
to
stay
for
the
theater
but
our
rate
did
say
morning
coffee
the
robes
were
not
in
the
room
and
it
took
a
long
time
hours
but
other
than
that
a
great
place
the
concierge
was
excellent

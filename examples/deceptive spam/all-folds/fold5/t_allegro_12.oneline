i
am
a
fan
of
kimpton
hotels
however
i
have
never
experienced
top
service
as
i
did
at
the
hotel
allegro
even
before
my
visit
concierge
mark
kraemer
advised
us
on
things
to
see
and
booked
tickets
in
advance
to
second
city
we
were
welcomed
warmly
on
arrival
and
the
bellman
checked
up
on
us
as
we
came
and
went
from
the
hotel
all
the
staff
have
a
personal
interest
in
making
your
stay
a
great
experience
the
hotel
is
next
to
city
hall
where
i
had
some
business
we
had
a
large
quiet
room
and
used
room
service
the
meal
came
quickly
and
included
a
a
bonus
fruit
cup
enjoyed
the
pasta
night
dollars
for
a
three
course
meal
at
the
restaurant
the
starter
and
the
dessert
were
wonderful
the
main
pasta
a
bit
too
salty
and
that
is
the
only
complaint
i
can
make
from
start
to
finish
if
you
want
attentive
service
this
is
the
place
to
be
thank
you
hotel
allegro
for
a
great
stay
i
cangt
wait
to
return

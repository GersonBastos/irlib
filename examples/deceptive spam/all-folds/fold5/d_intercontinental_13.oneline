a
great
view
of

a

with
a
coffeemaker
where
you
got
complimentary
coffee
and

was
great

did
not
have
to
go
out
for
my
morning
cup
of
coffee
there
was
a
business
center
that
had
internet
fax
machines
and
copy
machines
that
was
available
for
use
hours
a
day
one
of

favorite
things
was
the

had
masseurs
it
was
exactly
what
i
needed
very
relaxing

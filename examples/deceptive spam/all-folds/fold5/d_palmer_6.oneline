really
enjoyed
our
stay
at
the
palmer
house
hilton
we
were
in
chicago
for
a
weekend
stay
and
wanted
something
close
to
state
street
and
convenient
to
the
theatre
district
and
the
museums
and
michigan
ave
shopping
this
is
a
grand
old
hotel
with
just
about
every
amenity
one
could
wish
for
the
lobby
is
fabulous
and
the
hotel
also
has
some
nice
restaurants
our
room
had
a
nice
king
sized
bed
and
was
pretty
cozy
hotel
employees
were
very
nice
and
helpful
to
us
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
hotel
if
you
want
a
grand
hotel
type
experience
at
a
reasonable
price
for
the
many
amenities
and
in
a
very

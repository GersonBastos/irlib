stayed
at
the
intercontinental
for
an
entire
week
on
business

for
the
most
part
a
very
elegant
convenient
visit

in
the
historic
tower
very
nice
rooms
great
view
attentive
staff
convenient
location
just
north
of
the
tribune
tower
the
river
and
nice
fitness

for
the
entire

only
downside

couldngt
get
over

feeling
that
i
was
being

wi
fi
bottles
of
water
in
the
room
mini
bottle
of
wine
in
the
fridge

carrying
the
same

is
zagat
rated
though
igm
not
sure
why
within
a
minute
walk
there
are
plenty
of
great
restaurants
with
much
better
food
than
zest

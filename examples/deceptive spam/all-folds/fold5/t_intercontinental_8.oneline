we
stayed
at
the
intercontinental
for
three
nights
last
weekend
it
is
a
located
in
a
fantastic
spot
on
the
magnificent
mile
right
near
the
chicago
river
and
the
nbc
building
we
had
a
double
room
in
the
main
tower
the
room
was
very
clean
and
updated
the
staff
were
very
friendly
and
helpful
the
negatives
about
this
hotel
is
that
you
have
to
pay
extra
to
use
the
fitness
centre
and
internet
access
also
parking
is
high
valet
day
overall
we
had
a
great
stay
and
would
recommend
this
hotel
we
paid
on
priceline
and
felt
that
this
was
a
reasonable
price

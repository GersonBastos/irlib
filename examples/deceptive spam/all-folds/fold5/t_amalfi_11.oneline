we
attended
a
bachorette
party
in
chicago
in
aug
there
were
girls
total
we
had
rooms
and
i
did
not
hear
one
complaint
from
anyone
during
our
entire
extended
weekend
never
been
to
chi
town
before
i
booked
our
hotel
based
on
reviews
from
ta
and
we
were
not
disappointed
the
staff
is
wonderful
the
happy
hour
was
just
fabulous
the
room
was
nice
and
clean
with
a
great
double
headed
shower
and
aveda
products
was
an
extra
bonus
then
you
also
get
free
internet
in
your
room
the
hotel
was
chic
and
hip
without
the
pretentiousness
we
still
talk
about
what
a
wonderful
time
we
had
and
we
all
agree
that
if
we
ever
go
back
to
chicago
we
will
be
staying
at
the
amalfi
again

me

pics
dongt

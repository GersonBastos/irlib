we
got
an
awesome
deal
through
priceline
for
a
friday
sunday
stay
at
for
each
night
the
hotel
is
very
centrally
located
on
michigan
avenue
the
magnificent
mile
you
can
walk
to
a
ton
of
shops
there
are
plenty
of
restaurants
handy
as
well
the
hotel
staff
was
very
friendly
and
the
room
itself
was
gorgeous
very
modern
decor
not
drab
typical
like
most
other
chain
hotels
if
staying
in
chicago
we
definitely
will
be
staying
there
again
price
for
valet
parking
overnight
was
insane
but
what
do
you
expect
in
a
big
city

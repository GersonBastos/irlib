the
amalfi
hotel
in
chicago
is
a
wonderful
hotel
i

the

longer
the

so
nice

really
treat
you
like
a
vip
and
are
there
to
help
with
any
questions
you
might
have

so
beautifully
decorated
that
you
wish
you
could
hire
their
designer
to
do
your
home
in
my
room
i
had
access
to
my
own
personal
dvd
and
cd
collection

i
say

didngt
even
have
to
leave
or
order
something
on
the
television
it
was
nice
to
shower
with
their
aveda
products
and
get
into
my
microfiber
robe
and
slippers
that
they
supplied
me
while
staying
in
for
the
night
i
was
also
able
to
use
my
laptop
in
my
room
since
they
have
wifi
throughout
the
hotel
the
bed
was
very
comfortable

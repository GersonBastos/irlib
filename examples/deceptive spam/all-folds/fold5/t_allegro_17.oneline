we
brought
our
giant
rottweiler
and
she
had
a
great
time
small
rooms
but
this
is
normal
for
the
chicago
hotel
scene
lots
of
interesting
amenities
in
the
room
convenient
to
theatres
and
downtown
restaurants
and
shopping
really
loved
the
lobby
a
great
place
to
hang
around
or
wait
for
someone
lots
of
nooks
and
crannies
and
little
tables
and
sofas
everywhere
watch
outg
the
concierge
like
all
concierges
at
big
hotels
will
direct
you
to
mediocre
large
restaurants
where
they
get
kickbacks
we
have
stayed
here
several
times
and
i
always
check
for
rooms
here
when
i
travel
to
chicago
however
the
hotel
is
often
full
so
book
early

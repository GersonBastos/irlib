having
stayed
in
standard
hotels
before
when
my
wife
suggested
we
stay
in
an
upscale
hotel
for
our
weekend
in
chicago
i
was
skeptical
to
say
the
least
after
staying
at
the
amalfi
hotel
i
may
never
stay
in
a
regular
motel
again
right
off
the
bat
instead
of
a
foot
counter
with
snooty
workers
or
kids
that
started
two
days
ago
they
have
individual
desks
for
check
in
with
people
that
ggasp*
have
a
clue
as
to
what
they
are
doing
we
got
the
steakhouse
package
deal
at
the
on
site
keefergs
steakhouse
restaurant
the
food
was
the
highest
quality
and
cooked
to
perfection
the
room
was
spacious
had
robes
and
slippers
a
stocked
mini
bar
the
mattress
was
comfy
and
the
whole
room
was
clean
the
staff
was
amazing
and
had
no
problems
bringing
extra
towels
and
pillows
for
my
wife
in
the
morning
the
continental
breakfast
was
served
on
each
floor
instead
of
herding
into
the
lobby
which
i
loved
cause
i
love
breakfast
but
not
crowds
unfortunately
for
me
the
hotel
was
close
to
a
lot
of
shopping
my
wife
was
in
heaven
however
and
we
spent
a
large
portion
of
the
day
on
the
magnificent
mile
attempting
to
max
out
my
credit
cards
the
whole
trip
i
believe
was
made
special
by
the
atmosphere
of
the
hotel
and
its
staff
i
would
recommend
the
amalfi
to
anyone
visiting
chicago

a
review
about

free
stuff

now
igm
going
to
write
about
the
location
i
like
to
walk
this
place
was
close
to
everything
the
gtaste
of
chicagog
was
on
during
the
of
july
let
me
tell
you
this
was
the
best
gtaste'
of
a
city
that
i
have
ever
been
to
it
was
massive
and
took
mins
to
walk
there
i
took
the
train
in
from
the
airport
it
was
around
but
it
was
a
solid
mins
but
for
how
can
you
complain
and
it
was
approx
a
walk
to
the
hotel
we
pretty
much
walked
everywhere
we
walked
the
entire
magnificent
mile
strip
we
went
to
the
blue
navy
or
whatever
the
docks
are
called
my
favourite
bar
was
gpops
for
champagne
g
wow
i
love
champagne
and
then
of
course
there
was
the
john
hancock
centre
and
lots
of
shopping

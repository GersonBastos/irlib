booked
via
priceline
com
for
a
weekend
getaway
and
got
the
room
for
per
night
when
we
arrived
via
midway
we
took
the
orange
line
to
within
a
block
of
the
hotel
for
just
hotel
easy
to
find
never
felt
uncomfortable
with
the
neighborhood
area
saw
very
few
homeless
or
panhandlers
walked
all
over
the
place
great
location
and
hotel
is
about
a
cab
ride
from
most
major
attractions
shopping
restaurants
hotel
is
almost
gawdy
with
colors
decor
but
itgs
not
that
different
from
a
cruise
ship
decor
it
was
not
annoying
decor
by
any
means
check
in
was
painless
and
the
service
was
great
heard
no
noise
whatsoever
the
reports
of
thin
walls
are
greatly
exaggerated
the
walls
are
all
concrete
and
thick
we
heard
nothing
both
nights
we
were
there
highly
recommend
this
hotel
rooms
are
small
but
not
crowded
for
two
people
they
are
old
style
hotel
rooms
very
classic

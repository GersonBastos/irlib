stayed
here
for
nights
while
visiting
chicago
for
the
first
time
the
location
is
great
the
hotel
has
been
recently
renovated
and
our
room
was
very
spacious
with
two
bathrooms
the
lobby
is
a
great
place
to
chill
and
have
a
drink
didngt
eat
in
the
restaurant
but
there
are
a
few
good
ones
nearby
and
we
were
beside
the
art
institute
cultural
centre
macys
staff
were
friendly
would
recommend
it
as
a
base
to
tour
the
city

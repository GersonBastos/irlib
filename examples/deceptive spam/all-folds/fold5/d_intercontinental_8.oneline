my
familygs
seven
day
stay
at
the
intercontinental
chicago
hotel
was
more
than
i
could
ever
imagine
the
intercontinental
is
more
fantastic
than
any
previous
hotel
i
have
visited
because
of
its
wonderful
amenities
such
as
the
excellent
hour
room
service
access
to
personal
trainers
and
even
a
dry
cleaning
service
just
to
mention
a
few
my
family
really
enjoyed
dining
on
the
contemporary
american
cuisine
at
the
hotels
zest
restaurant
which
served
an
excellent
meal
worth
every
dime
of
its
reasonable
price
my
most
favorite
point
about
the
intercontinental
chicago
is
that
it
provides
entry
right
into
the
windy
city
where
my
family
and
i
had
immediate
access
to
transportation
shopping
and
city
attractions
we
had
a
great
time
traveling
through
chicago
and
enjoying
ourselves
while
at
the
same
time
we
felt
secure
knowing
that
we
had
a
nice
clean
elegant
safe
hotel
to
travel
back
to
whenever
we
were
done
touring
the
city
each
day
the
intercontinental
is
a
must
stay
and
i
will
recommend
them
to
anyone
who
plans
on
visiting
chicago

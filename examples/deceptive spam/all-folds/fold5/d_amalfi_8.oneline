my
wife
and
me
stayed
in
the
amalfi
hotel
chicago
last
august
in
a
weekend
visit
to
chicago
the
hotel
is
located
in
the
w
kinzie
st
in
the
well
known
river
north
district
we
got
what
the
hotel
promisedg
gentle
staff
a
luxury
room
with
a
breathtaking
view
magnificent
meals
and
a
select
wine
i
also
used
its
well
equipped
gymnasium
we
paid
with
taxes
for
two
nights
i
think
it
was
a
good
price
taking
in
account
the
excellent
conditions
we
got
there
i
would
recommend
the
amalfi
hotel
to
anybody
with
good
taste
that
visits
chicago

for
top
class
treatment
choose
hotel
allegro
in
all
of
my
years
of
buisness
travel
and
vacationing
i
have
never
been
more
happy
with
the
service
at
a
hotel
than
i
was
at
hotel
allegro
i
searched
many
hotel
websites
looking
for
the
perfect
hotel
to
spend
our
honeymoon
and
hotel
allegro
seemed
like
the
right
choice
soon
as
i
walked
into
to
their
elaborate
lobby
area
it
was
like
i
was
a
big
shot
on
wallstreet
the
service
was
excellent
and
the
best
part
they
allow
animals
they
treated
my
little
dog
johnny
like
he
was
royalty
they
have
everything
you
could
ever
need
in
a
hotel
from
in
room
spa
service
to
a
workout
center
they
even
made
sure
that
i
had
all
of
my
drinks
and
amentites
ready
for
the
monday
night
bears
game
if
i
were
to
give

rate
it
from
a

to
give
it
a
many
times
over

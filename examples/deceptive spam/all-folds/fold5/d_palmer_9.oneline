amazing
i
was
swept
away
when
i
walked
into
the
hotel
it
was
gorgeous
the
staff
was
very
nice
and
helpful
the
hotel
was
very
clean
and
the
food
was
delicious
we
stayed
two
nights
and
the
first
night
we
went
to
the
lockwood
restaurant
and
we
were
blown
away
by
the
food
it
has
to
be
the
best
food
in
chicago
the
atmosphere
was
very
classy
and
warm
and
the
wait
staff
was
very
precise
the
decor
in
our
rooms
did
not
look
like
any
hotel
i
had
been
at
they
were
very
elegant
and
inviting
i
cannot
wait
to
go
back
it
is
a
true
escape
from
daily
life

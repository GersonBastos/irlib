it
has
been
a
couple
of
years
since
i
stayed
here
and
got
it
for
a
night
last
weekend
on
hotwire
i
paid
only
and
stayed
a
saturday
night
i
was
very
impressed
with
the
redecorating
done
to
the
hotel
the
lobby
has
always
been
great
but
the
rooms
were
a
little
shabby
in
the
past
not
any
more
as
the
hotel
has
been
redecorated
in
the
last
few
years
the
location
is
still
amazing
and
with
the
berghoff
open
again
there
is
a
great
restaurant
within
walking
distance

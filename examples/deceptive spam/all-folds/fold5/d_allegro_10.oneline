when
i
had
to
visit
chicago
for
business
i
asked
some
of
my
associates
where
to
stay
and
several
of
them
recommended
the
hotel
allegro
after
my
stay
i
can
honestly
say
that
i
agree
from
the
luxurious
bedding
to
the
technological
amenities
everything
was
thought
of
the
only
place
i
find
more
comfortable
then
this
hotel
is
my
actual
home
i
now
know
where
i
will
be
staying
every
time
i
have
business
in
this
city
and
anyone
i
know
who
is
doing
the
same
will
hear
so

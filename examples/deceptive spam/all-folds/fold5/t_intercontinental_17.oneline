my
wife
and
i
stayed
here
for
a
long
weekend
and
it
was
great
the
check
in
staff
changed
our
room
to
a
single
bed
without
question
and
the
bar
served
the
best
martini
i
have
had
in
a
while
the
rooms
were
well
decorated
and
spacious
although
it
did
get
a
little
tight
through
the
bathroom
door
the
bell
staff
was
very
accomodating
and
walked
my
wife
up
to
our
room
when
she
arrived
late
i
would
definitely
stay
here
again

the
intercontinental
chicago
hotel
is
one
of
the
finest
hotels
i
have
stayed
at
in
a
long
time
the
atmosphere
upon
arrival
was
one
of
elegance
and
beauty
the
staff
welcomed
us
and
catered
to
our
every
need
the
rooms
were
plush
and
very
romantic
interior
decor
was
breathtaking
it
is
definitely
above
a
star
rating
and
i
would
not
think
twice
about
coming
back
here
it
received
my
highest
recommendation

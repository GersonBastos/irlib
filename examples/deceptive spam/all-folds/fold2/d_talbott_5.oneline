the
rates
at
the
talbott
hotel
were
cheaper
than
i
had
expected
and
that
was
my
reason
for
booking
a
room
i
had
been
prepared
for
service
and
a
room
similar
to
what
i
had
experienced
in
the
past
and
i
was
quite
pleased
when
i
did
stay
the
room
was
neat
and
clean
and
the
halls
were
quiet
at
night
the
traffic
noise
was
muffled
to
the
point
where
it
was
no
problem
sleeping
either
i
did
ask
one
question
at
the
service
desk
and
they
answered
it
nicely
which
is
good
because
normally
hotel
workers
can
be
a
bit
snippy
especially
at
night
overall
i
had
no
problems
with
the
talbott
hotel
and
i
would
stay
at
this
here
again
if
i
were
in
the
area
a
second
time

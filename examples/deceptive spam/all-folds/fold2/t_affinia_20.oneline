after
reading
the
reviews
getting
an
excellent
rate
through
travelzoo
i
decided
to
give
this
hotel
a
try
i
must
say
it
was
a
great
choice
the
location
is
perfect
just
off
from
n
michigan
ave
walking
distance
from
everything
the
staff
was
very
helpful
and
friendly
and
the
room
was
excellent
they
gave
us
a
corner
room
w
a
great
view
as
many
have
posted
the
bed
pillows
were
very
comfortable
i
am
very
picky
about
that
i
slept
well
every
night
the
renovation
is
almost
done
did
not
bother
us
one
bit
i
highly
recommend
this
hotel

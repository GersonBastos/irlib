my
husband
and
i
recently
stayed
at
the
hard
rock
hotel
chicago
and
we
cangt
wait
to
go
back
the
hotel
is
located
in
downtown
chicago
and
seems
to
be
at
the
heart
of
the
city
we
were
close
to
everything
the
hard
rock
hotel
is
forty
stories
high
and
the
view
from
our
room
was
simply
breathtaking
the
room
itself
was
spotless
and
featured
modern
luxurious
decor
and
furnishings
the
bed
was
heavenly
the
hotel
staff
was
friendly
upbeat
and
extremely
helpful
we
asked
for
directions
and
restaurant
recommendations
and
they
were
spot
on
with
both
i
highly
recommend
the
hard
rock
hotel
in
chicago
and
i
would
stay
there
again
in
a
heartbeat

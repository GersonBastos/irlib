my
husband
and
i
decided
to
plan
a
romantic
get
away
for
our
one
year
anniversary
when
we
stumbled
upon
the
talbott
hotel
in
chicago
we
decided
to
book
the
personally
yours
romance
package
for
our
stay
when
we
arrived
at
the
hotel
the
staff
was
very
friendly
and
approachable
the
personalized
key
cards
we
received
upon
check
in
were
a
wonderful
touch
each
night
we
would
return
to
our
suite
to
find
the
linens
turned
down
and
rose
petals
scattered
across
the
bed
the
personal
concierge
even
helped
me
plan
a
special
outing
for
my
husband
and
i
to
see
a
chicago
cubs
baseball
game
i
would
recommend
this
hotel
to
anyone
planning
a
weekend
away

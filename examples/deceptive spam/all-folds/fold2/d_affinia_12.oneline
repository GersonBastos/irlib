this
hotel
is
fantastic
i
stayed
there
on
my
way
through
chicago
towards
arizona
and
could
not
believe
the
great
quality
of
the
hotel
igd
have
thought
i
was
in
a
vegas
suite
really
polite
staff
great
housekeeping
and
amazing
prices
on
my
way
out
i
was
telling
the
manager
about
how
much
igd
loved
the
hotel
and
he
even
offered
me
an
extra
night
there
you
can
safely
say
that
my
trip
was
delayed
roughly
hours

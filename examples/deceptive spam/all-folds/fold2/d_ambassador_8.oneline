the
ambassador
east
hotel
located
in
downtown
chicago
is
one
of
the
best
hotels
igve
ever
stayed
in
my
wife
and
i
went
into
the
city
on
a
weekend
getaway
and
found
the
ambassador
east
on
a
hotel
booking
website
their
rates
are
very
very
reasonable
for
the
high
class
and
luxury
that
they
provide
i
was
pleased
to
know
that
they
allow
pets
as
we
decided
to
go
into
the
city
last
minute
and
couldngt
find
anyone
to
watch
our
dog
for
the
weekend
i
was
more
than
pleased
with
the
friendly
staff
and
felt
like
their
hotel
put
an
extra
emphasis
on
knowing
their
customer
which
is
nice
because
most
places
in
chicago
are
very
impersonal
all
in
all
i
was
very
pleased
with
our
stay
and
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
looking
for
a
place
to
stay
in
the
downtown
area

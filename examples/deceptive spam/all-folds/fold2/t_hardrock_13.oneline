the
hard
rock
hotel
is
great
for
a
relaxing
getaway
the
rooms
are
quiet
the
bed
is
comfortable
and
the
bathroom
is
a
nice
size
we
had
fabulous
service
and
got
a
great
rate
other
than
the
fact
that
there
were
no
bathrobes
itgs
listed
as
an
amenity
and
the
sony
radio
didngt
work
it
was
perfect
would
definitely
stay
there
again

we
stayed
here
because
of
all
the
great
reviews
and
itgs
all
true
we
were
highly
impressed
with
the
high
quality
of
everything
everyone
and
the
location
walking
distance
to
much
of
what
chicago
has
to
offer
gibsongs
steakhouse
and
the
hancock
building
to
name
a
couple
this
hotel
should
really
be
in
the
top
ten
or
even
top
five
hotels
for
chicago
it
should
also
have
more
than
three
stars
i
mean
three
stars
is
for
the
hilton
garden
inn
or
marriott
courtyard
and
this
place
far
exceeds
chain
hotels
like
those
depending
on
the
room
you
get
any
price
under
would
be
a
good
deal
between
could
still
be
worth
it

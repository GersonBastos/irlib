my
husband
and
i
stayed
here
for
three
nights
while
visiting
chicago
as
tourists
what
a
beautiful
hotel
our
room
was
lovely
the
staff
was
super
helpful
and
the
location
was
convenient
they
dongt
have
an
in
house
gym
but
each
day
you
can
get
a
day
pass
to
a
cushy
gym
down
the
street
the
restaurant
in
the
hotel
has
a
very
yummy
breakfast
the
concierge
helped
us
to
make
dinner
reservations
at
the
last
minute
our
first
night
there
we
were
able
to
walk
down
the
magnificent
mile
from
our
hotel
as
well
as
through
the
gold
coast
and
old
towne
neighborhoods
there
are
tons
of
great
restaurants
in
the
area
including
the
famous
gibsons
and
the
signature
room
in
the
hancock
tower
as
well
as
lots
of
shopping
there
is
currently
a
lot
of
construction
going
on
near
the
talbott
they
are
building
condos
right
behind
it
but
regardless
we
had
a
wonderful
stay
and
would
definitely
stay
there
again
when
visiting
chicago

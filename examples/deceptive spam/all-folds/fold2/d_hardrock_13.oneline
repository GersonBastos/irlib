i
was
looking
for
an
unique
hip
experience
in
a
hotel
that
offered
the
convenient
location
of
downtown
chicago
my
choice
for
hotel
was
obviousg
hard
rock
hotel
chicago
if
you
are
wondering
whether
hard
rock
hotels
are
schmaltzy
or
cliche
they
are
not
hard
rock
hotel
chicago
is
modern
trendy
and
hip
it
had
an
air
that
this
was
where
musicians
came
to
rock
among
the
stories
and
there
are
details
that
you
wongt
find
elsewhere
for
example
one
interesting
perk
is
some
free
itunes
downloads
i
got
ten
for
guests
itgs
a
fun
place
hosting
events
such
as
jack

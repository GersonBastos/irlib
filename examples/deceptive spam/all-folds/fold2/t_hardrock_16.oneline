i
stayed
here
august
through
with
my
sixteen
year
old
son
and
we
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
hotel
the
price
was
very
reasonable
for
a
hotel
located
right
on
michigan
avenue
the
front
desk
and
concierge
service
was
excellent
and
enhanced
our
stay
by
making
it
easy
for
us
to
plan
fun
activities
the
john
entwistle
theme
on
our
floor
was
a
nice
touch
any
of
you
single
fathers
out
there
can
appreciate
how
difficult
it
can
be
to
take
a
fun
affordable
vacation
with
your
children
and
the
hard
rock
hotel
in
chicago
really
helped
me
accomplish
just
that

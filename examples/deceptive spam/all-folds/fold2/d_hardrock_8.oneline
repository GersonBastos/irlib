after
searching
for
the
perfect
hotel
for
my
chicago
getaway
i
knew
once
i
came
across
the
hard
rock
hotel
that
this
was
the
hotel
for
me
after
seeing
the
exceptional
accommodations
the
hotel
offered
i
booked
my
reservations
right
away
when
i
arrived
at
the
hotel
i
was
astonished
at
how
beautiful
and
big
the
building
and
grounds
were
kept
i
was
greeted
warmly
by
the
front
staff
and
received
my
room
key
within
a
few
minutes
i
was
also
given
helpful
pointers
to
nearby
attractions
and
restaurants
i
took
the
elevator
up
to
my
room
and
when
i
opened
the
door
my
jaw
dropped
as
the
views
of
the
chicago
skyline
was
impeccable
after
relaxing
i
went
down
to
the
bar
for
a
few
cocktails
and
was
impressed
by
the
fast
courteous
service
i
received
after
my
cocktail
hour
i
decided
to
unwind
and
let
me
tell
you
the
beds
must
be
sent
from
heaven
i
had
one
of
the
best
nights
of
sleep
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
i
highly
recommend
the
hard
rock
as
i
have
stayed
at
many
around
the
us
and
this
is
definitely
on
my
top
list
hope
you
all
enjoy
it
as
much
as
i
did
and
i
cangt
wait
to
return

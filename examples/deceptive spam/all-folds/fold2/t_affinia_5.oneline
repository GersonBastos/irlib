the
recently
remodeled
affina
was
amazing
from
the
choice
pillow
menu
to
the
stocked
pantry
and
refrigerator
to
the
brand
name
bathroom
ammenities
within
walking
distance
to
just
about
everything
you
could
possibly
need
the
affina
is
a
great
hotel
the
staff
was
pleasant
and
seemed
to
enjoy
their
jobs
having
never
stayed
in
downtown
chicago
before
the
affina
over
and
above
exceeded
our
expectations
although
our
trip
to
chicago
was
only
for
one
night
we
will
consider
staying
at
the
affina
again
for
a
future
visit

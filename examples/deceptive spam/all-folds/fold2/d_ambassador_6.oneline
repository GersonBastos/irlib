i
am
writing
about
my
recent
stay
at
the
ambassador
east
hotel
i
just
wanted
to
let
you
know
what
a
wonderful
team
you
have
working
there
everyone
from
check
in
to
check
out
couldngt
have
been
more
helpful
or
personable
it
made
my
mundane
business
trip
a
very
pleasureable
one
the
hotel
is
spotless
very
comfortable
and
the
restaurant
is
one
of
chicagogs
finest
you
really
offer
the
finest
quality
in
both
product
and
service
the
only
complaint
i
have
is
that
internet
access
is
not
free
i
would
just
like
to
mention
one
person
in
particular
sofie
she
worked
on
the
front
desk
and
she
went
above
and
beyond
to
make
my
stay
as
smooth
as
possible
she
even
helped
me
out
with
taxi
services
and
local
recommendations
i
shall
look
forward
to
returning
next
month
thank
you
yours

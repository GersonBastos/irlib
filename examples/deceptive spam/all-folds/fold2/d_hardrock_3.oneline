this
fantastic
hotel
has
it
allg
luxury
an
excellent
location
and
a
fun
atmosphere
the
rooms
are
spacious
and
well
decorated
and
the
staff
is
always
helpful
and
courteous
whether
yougre
traveling
for
business
or
fun
i
highly
recommend
the
hard
rock
hotel
in
chicago
i
stayed
there
with
my
wife
recently
we
were
on
a
short
weekend
break
and
we
wanted
to
enjoy
the
music
an
just
have
fun
the
hard
rock
certainly
delivered
what
we
were
looking
for
the
hotel
is
in
a
central
location
within
easy
reach
of
the
main
tourist
spots
in
the
city
however
theregs
superb
food
on
site
and
the
best
entertainment
you
could
wish
for
so
theregs
barely
a
need
to
leave
to
hotel
well
we
did
leave
the
hotel
to
see
the
sights
but
you
know
what
i
mean
my
wife
and
i
particularly
enjoyed
the
gym
and
spa
facilities
including
a
relaxing
massage
this
hotel
surpassed
our
expectations
in
every
possible
way
and
wegll
surely
be
staying
there
again
the
next
time
we
visit
the
windy
city

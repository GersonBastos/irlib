my
stay
at
the
ambassador
east
hotel
was
a
pleasant
one
i
loved
being
able
to
take
a
quick
stroll
to
michigan
ave
for
some
shopping
i
also
loved
the
pump
room
what
a
fun
place
to
hang
out
and
enjoy
a
blood
mary
the
front
desk
staff
was
wonderful
with
my
check
in
since
my
reservation
was
lost
they
found
me
a
room
immediately
even
though
the
city
was
book
up
i
thought
the
rooms
were
clean
and
well
maintained
the
shampoo
was
great
and
i
decided
to
take
it
home
with
me
i
am
looking
forward
to
another
stay
at
the
ambassador
east
in
the
spring
when
i
return
to
chicago

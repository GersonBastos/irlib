stayed
at
the
chicago
affinia
dec
thru
dec
and
was
very
impressed
with
the
staff
the
room
and
the
location
close
to
shopping
and
the
pizza
place
next
door
was
great
of
course
there
were
many
other
restaraunts
nearby
as
well
i
had
a
little
trouble
figuring
out
the
heat
but
it
was
fine
once
i
learned
how
to
set
it
they
were
working
on
the
hotel
so
we
got
a
great
rate
but
the
work
never
bothered
us
the
room
was
great
with
the
walk
in
shower
in
the
spacious
bathroom
a
wonderful
surprise
i
would
definately
stay
here
again
and
would
recommend
to
others

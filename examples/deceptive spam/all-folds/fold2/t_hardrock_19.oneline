i
was
attending
a
conference
at
the
mariott
they
were
booked
up
and
i
shared
a
room
at
the
hard
rock
for
a
week
by
default
what
a
lucky
break
this
is
a
beautiful
hotel
i
am
not
a
fan
of
all
that
black
grey
vibe
and
find
it
a
little
cheesy
what
i
loved
was
the
way
the
hard
rock
left
the
beautiful
old
hotel
features
intact
and
decorated
around
the
basic
stucture
my
room
was
clean
clean
clean
i
want
to
comment
on
the
staff
what
an
upbeat
group
of
people
this
included
the
doormen
the
front
desk
the
consierge
they
were
wonderful
every
morning
one
of
the
bell
men
would
find
my
tv
morning
news
show
for
me
in
the
bar
while
i
drank
their
courtesy
coffee
they
brought
us
a
refrigerator
ipod
dock
and
extra
suitcase
stand
within
minutes
of
check
in
i
had
a
hard
time
contacting
the
airport
transport
the
consierge
took
care
of
it
for
me
while
i
was
waiting
for
the
am
airport
shuttle
one
of
the
bell
men
found
me
a
cup
of
coffee
in
the
back
i
just
couldngt
get
over
how
nice
and
friendly
everyone
was
great
place
to
stay
i
hope
to
go
back
with
my
husband

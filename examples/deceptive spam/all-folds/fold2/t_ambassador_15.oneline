we
just
returned
from
nights
at
the
ambassador
east
what
a
gem
the
location
in
the
gold
coast
neighborhood
is
perfect
for
finding
restaurants
and
walking
the
magnificent
mile
there
is
a
train
station
about
blocks
away
the
room
was
very
comfortable
with
nice
amenities
and
there
is
free
internet
service
on
the
floor
best
of
all
was
the
bell
and
lobby
staff
they
really
went
out
of
their
way
to
be
helpful
and
greeted
us
warmly
each
time
we
left
and
arrived
i
would
say
that
this
was
the
nicest
hotel
staff
igve
encountered
in
all
my
travels

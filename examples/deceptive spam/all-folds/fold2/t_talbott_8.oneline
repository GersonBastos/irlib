this
is
a
great
find
for
downtown
chicago
the
price
is
right
and
the
staff
are
excellent
as
noted
there
is
construction
going
on
around
the
hotel
but
i
didngt
notice
any
issues
that
disturbed
sleeping
i
asked
for
a
quiet
room
on
an
upper
floor
and
was
gladly
given
one
the
lobby
is
small
the
atmosphere
is
that
of
a
small
boutique
hotel
the
concierge
stephanie
did
a
super
job
in
finding
us
a
restaurant
and
booking
us
reservations
along
with
a
complimentary
appetizer
we
had
a
standard
room
and
it
was
spacious
tastefully
decorated
everything
we
needed
the
bathroom
had
a
nice
whirlpool
tub
for
soaking
and
the
compatible
radio
was
a
nice
perk
just
cangt
say
enough
about
how
nice
the
staff
are
every
single
person
you
meet
would
definitely
stay
here
again

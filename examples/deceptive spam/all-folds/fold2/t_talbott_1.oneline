very
quaint
and
romantic
yet
masculine
igve
noticed
that
at
most
chicago
hotel
bars
itgs
hard
to
get
a
drink
much
less
a
seat
but
i
guess
because
itgs
a
small
hotel
that
was
not
a
problem
at
the
talbott
plus
people
take
their
drinks
out
to
the
seating
in
the
lobby
because
itgs
so
inviting
cozy
and
comfortable
love
that
would
love
to
stay
again
but
i
must
say
that
i
was
surprised
by
all
the
comments
on
the
comfortable
beds
ours
was
too
firm
also
note
there
is
no
gym
on
the
premises
but
walking
and
shopping
is
enough
of
a
workout

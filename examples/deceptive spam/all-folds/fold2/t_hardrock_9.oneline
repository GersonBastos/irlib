my
husband
and
l
stayed
here
after
a
very
hectic
week
in
new
york
the
room
was
very
spacious
and
clean
the
bed
was
huge
and
extremely
comfortable
i
really
liked
the
aveda
bathroom
products
great
smell
we
had
room
service
the
first
night
and
it
arrived
really
quick
and
piping
hot
compliments
to
the
chef
the
concierge
was
very
helpful
as
we
needed
to
find
a
few
places
and
we
were
meeting
up
with
friends
and
did
not
know
how
to
get
to
navy
pier
directions
were
given
to
us
accompanied
by
a
map
the
weekend
we
were
there
it
was
their
annual
air
and
navy
show
this
was
spectacular
the
whole
of
the
last
day
of
the
show
we
spent
at
navy
pier
and
the
millenium
park
location
of
the
hotel
is
very
good
for
most
things
especially
shopping
if
we
are
ever
in
chicago
again
we
will
definately
stay
here

as
we
pulled
away
in
a
taxi
heading
to
the
airport
for
our
trip
home
my
wife
turned
to
me
and
said
we
picked
the
right
place
having
chosen
the
talbott
from
other
trip
advisor
reviews
i
found
myself
thinking
in
terms
of
a
trip
advisor
review
when
we
arrived
nice
entrance
friendly
reception
i
noticed
everything
and
immediately
knew
the
talbott
was
a
non
corporate
warm
hotel
with
touches
not
typically
seen
in
big
name
hotel
chains
the
smell
of
the
elevator
and
attention
to
decorative
details
strongly
reminded
me
of
europe
simple
not
overstated
but
elegant
the
location
is
great
there
was
light
snow
but
we
walked
to
the
art
institute
rush
street
the
theater
district
and
wegre
from
california
where
anything
below
degrees
keeps
us
inside
all
i
can
say
is
if
you
are
the
kind
of
traveler
that
wants
comfort
class
and
somewhere
unique
stay
at
the
talbott
oh
yeah
we
were
in
a
room
that
looked
down
at
the
construction
we
were
on
the
floor
and
could
not
hear
a
sound
it
was
very
quiet

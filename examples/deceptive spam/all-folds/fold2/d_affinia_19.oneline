i
first
walk
into
the
beautifully
decorated
lobby
of
the
affinia
chicago
hotel
where
igm
greeted
by
name
by
the
concierge
he
tells
me
that
they
have
taken
the
liberty
of
customizing
the
room
to
my
profile
from
when
i
booked
the
stay
he
shows
me
to
my
room
paying
careful
attention
to
my
bags
and
ensuring
that
i
needngt
lift
a
finger
sure
enough
the
down
pillow
i
had
selcted
from
the
dream
pillow
menu
sits
proudly
atop
the
queen
of
the
domain
which
by
the
way
is
covered
with
the
softest
of
bedspreads
making
me
wonder
if
they
didngt
literally
drag
a
cloud
in
here
and
fit
it
on
my
bed
i
notice
that
theregs
a
display
of
champagne
and
cupcakes
atop
the
dresser
and
my
experience
kit
which
comes
complete
with
an
ipod
shuffle
downloaded
with
only
my
favorite
workout
tracks
and
a
yoga
mat
namaste
unable
to
resist
the
urge
to
inspect
the
bathroom
i
find
that
not
only
is
there
a
marble
tiled
invisible
glass
shower
but
a
jacuzzi
lined
with
candles
of
vanilla
deep
enough
to
bathe
a
walrus
feeling
girlish
i
run
the
water
and
test
before
going
to
dinner
the
hotelgs
restraunt
c
house
offers
the
most
delicious
seafood
menu
that
makes
you
think
yougre
dining
with
the
kings
of
paradise
or
at
least
eating
in
the
caribbean
itself
hmm
i
should
have
brought
a
date

i
took
my
family
to
the
affinia
chicago
for
a
short
vacation
last
summer
and
it
was
fabulous
my
kids
say
that
their
favorite
part
was
the
pool
and
the
fact
that
the
amusement
park
is
really
close
by
my
wife
was
really
stoked
with
spaffina
the
pampering
and
really
made
her
feel
special
and
they
are
very
attentive
to
pets
also
my
dog
we
left
home
but
he
would
have
been
stoked
with
the
pets
amenities
and
attention
the
hotel
is
also
connected
to
a
ton
of
other
hotels
so
their
stash
award
lets
you
earn
points
at
a
lot
of
other
hotels
also
my
favorite
part
of
all
was
that
my
family
was
happy
and
content
which
left
me
free
to
go
over
to
underground
wonderbar
for
a
nice
cocktail

just
returned
from
a
night
stay
at
the
talbott
this
was
our
first
visit
there
and
i
can
honestly
say
that
i
wouldngt
stay
at
any
other
hotel
in
chicago
from
when
we
first
were
greated
by
the
bell
captain
until
our
final
departure
the
staff
was
nothing
less
than
amazing
always
greeting
with
a
smile
and
can
i
help
you
attitute
the
room
we
had
was
very
spacious
and
comfortable
the
bed
was
probably
the
most
comfortable
that
my
wife
and
i
have
ever
slept
in
including
the
four
seasons
had
great
breakfasts
and
drinks
at
basilgs
you
would
be
missing
a
fantastic
experience
if
you
didngt
stay
at
the
talbott

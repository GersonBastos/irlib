we
live
down
the
block
from
the
hotel
we
arranged
to
have
new
floors
put
in
our
condo
while
we
were
away
the
floors
were
not
finished
when
we
returned
so
we
looked
for
an
inexpensive
local
hotel
for
one
night
i
think
the
ambassador
east
was
the
least
expensive
hotel
within
a
reasonable
distance
so
we
decided
to
stay
there
over
the
years
i
had
had
some
visiting
groups
stay
there
i
had
also
eaten
there
and
been
to
the
bar
but
i
had
never
stayed
there
myself
the
lobby
is
elegant
the
service
is
great
and
the
room
was
large
and
clean
although
a
little
outdated
the
location
is
the
best
residential
area
in
the
city
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
live
two
blocks
away
and
it
is
very
convenient
to
north
michigan
avenue
a
good
shopping
street
and
reasonably
convenient
to
the
loop
the
main
business
area
there
are
also
probably
restaurants
in
all
price
ranges
in
reasonable
walking
distance
including
some
of
the
best
in
the
city
i
paid
less
than
including
tax
for
one
night
i
am
not
sure
what
their
regular
rates
are
but
i
think
my
deal
was
the
best
travel
bargain
around

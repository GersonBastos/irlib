the
stunning
bay
at
chicago
finds
its
equal
in
the
ambassador
east
hotel
this
hotel
feels
like
luxury
was
built
into
everything
down
to
the
wonderful
room
service
and
conference
rooms
besides
being
in
an
active
neighborhood
in
chicago
the
ambassador
east
is
close
enough
to
the
action
and
beautiful
sights
chicago
has
to
offer
the

wonderful
i
felt
like

was
very
neat
regal
and
relaxing
i
especially
liked
the
bathroom
as
it

also
a

place
for
excellent
dining
my
stay
here
was
completely

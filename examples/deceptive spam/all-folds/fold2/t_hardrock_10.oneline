got
a
great
deal
through
hotwire
for
a
night
but
if
i
ever
return
to
chicago
i
would
definitely
stay
again
even
at
full
price
we
really
liked
the
rooms
muted
modern
decor
we
had
john
lennon
and
bono
for
company
comfortable
bed
mini
coffe
maker
plenty
storage
space
and
a
lovely
clean
bathroom
stocked
full
of
aveda
products
so
i
was
sold
straight
away
it
doesngt
take
much
i
know
if
yougre
a
product
junkie
tip
the
maid
and
request
some
extra
bottles
and
you
will
leave
with
lots
of
goodies
g
we
liked
the
location
and
had
a
great
view
down
n
michigan
ave
found
the
staff
to
be
really
friendly
and
relaxed
reception
gift
shop
and
bar
the
bar
area
is
very
trendy
i
liked
the
chilled
atmosphere
which
surprised
me
cause
i
normally
find
these
types
of
bars
a
bit
too
pretentious
for
my
liking
the
lack
of
memorabilia
didngt
bother
me
but
i
was
more
interested
in
the
art
deco
features
of
the
building
itself
anyway
the
only
fault
was
that
the
speakers
in
the
room
were
crackling
a
bit
oh
and
my
boyfriend
thinks
he
was
propositioned
by
a
friendly
lady
looking
for
business
when
he
was
at
the
bar
i
think
itgs
a
place
you
will
either
love
or
hate
if
you
like
laid
back
contemporary
hotels
without
the
intimidating
factor
then
this
is
the
place
for
you

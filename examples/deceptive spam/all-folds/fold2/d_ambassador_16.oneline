i
have
to
thank
the
ambassador
east
hotel
for
providing
a
really
great
experience
for
my
family
we
never
leave
our
dog
at
home
when
we
travel
and
itgs
been
a
long
time
since
wegve
been
able
to
find
a
place
of
this
caliber
that
allows
pets
the
staff
even
spent
time
cooing
over
how
cute
our
dog
is
when
we
asked
about
local
clothing
boutiques
my
husband
liked
the
fitness
room
it
was
nice
and
clean
with
plenty
of
extra
towels
available
it
was
colder
than
we
expected
with
the
wind
blowing
in
off
the
water
but
the
concierge
knew
exactly
where
we
should
go
for
jackets
and
scarves
we
will
definitely
be
staying
here
next
time
we
visit
chicago
we
would
make
the
trip
just
to
stay
here
thatgs
how
welcome
we
felt
when
we
stayed
at
this
hotel

we
booked
at
another
hotel
a
block
away
and
spent
a
unhappy
night
we
walked
over
to
the
talbott
and
the
courtiest
staff
showed
us
a
room
and
we
booked
the
rest
of
our
stay
the
room
was
very
attractive
and
well
furnished
with
double
sinks
in
the
bathroom
the
tub
is
large
and
the
shower
a
pleasure
the
location
was
quiet
as
requested
the
staff
was
always
cheerful
and
very
helpful
tim
and
stephanie
provide
excellent
concierge
services
the
breakfast
at
the
basil
cafe
is
a
great
way
to
start
the
day
we
travel
a
lot
and
appreciate
the
ambiance
of
a
good
hotel
i
would
highly
recommend
the
talbott
for
your
stay

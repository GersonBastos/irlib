we
stayed
at
the
hard
rock
for
one
night
to
do
some
intense
day
after
thanksgiving
shopping
it
really
is
a
great
hotel
the
rooms
are
really
cool
and
we
were
just
in
the
basic
one
the
bed
is
extremely
comfortable
with
the
softest
sheets
and
great
pillows
the
technology
in
the
room
is
great
they
have
nice
upscale
tolietries
in
the
bathrooms
for
a
very
modern
room
it
is
still
comfortable
and
homey
the
location
is
perfect
for
getting
wherever
you
want
to
go
the
staff
were
very
nice
and
helpful
the
bar
is
really
funky
with
an
interesting
martini
menu
one
of
the
best
hotels
i
have
stayed
at
in
chicago
really
enjoyed
it
and
would
highly
recommend

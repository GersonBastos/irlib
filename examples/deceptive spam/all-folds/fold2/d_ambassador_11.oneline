for
a
short
time
during
vacation
i
had
rented
a
room
from
the
ambassador
east
hotel
i
have
to
say
i
was
quite
impressed
with
what
i
experienced
and
would
referre
others
looking
to
stay
in
a
hotel
to
that
given
location
the
hotel
is
comfortable
and
spacey
with
nice
staff
who
are
always
polite
to
aid
you
whenever
it
is
needed
and
trust
me
i
am
not
the
nicest
person
in
the
world
so
this
says
a
lot
the
food
is
good
location
is
great
everything
is
easily
accessible
and
all
the
given
luxuries
of
a
hotel
are
well
kept
here

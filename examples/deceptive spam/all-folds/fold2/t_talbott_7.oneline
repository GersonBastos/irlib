my
husband
attended
a
conference
in
chicago
for
the
weekend
of
june
and
i
decided
to
tag
along
for
the
shopping
we
flew
into
oghare
and
took
a
cab
to
the
hotel
cost
about
everybody
from
the
doorman
to
reception
desk
to
concierge
were
extremely
friendly
and
helpful
we
had
a
room
on
the
floor
which
overlooked
the
construction
but
we
were
hardly
in
the
room
so
it
didngt
bother
us
we
were
also
never
awakened
due
to
construction
noise
and
my
husband
is
a
very
light
sleeper
the
room
was
clean
and
spacious
enough
for
us
the
bed
is
very
comfy
we
ate
in
the
restaurant
downstairs
several
times
for
breakfast
and
lunch
and
all
meals
were
great
the
location
of
this
hotel
is
perfect

are
about
blocks
from
michigan
ave
and
the
hancock
tower
cangt
beat
that
there
is
also
an
adorable
pet
store
called
tails
in
the
city
across
from
the
hotel
i
brought
our
dog
back
a
couple
of
toys
they
are
very
nice
as
well
all
in
all
no
complaints
the
hotel
is
clean
and
beyond
what
we
were
expecting
the
staff

always
friendly

the
location
is
superb

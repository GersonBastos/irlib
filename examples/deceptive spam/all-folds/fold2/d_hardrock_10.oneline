when
i
first
booked
my
reservation
at
this
hotel
honestly
i
didngt
know
what
to
expect
i
mean
igm
kind
of
a
music
person
but
this
was
my
first
real
experience
with
a
musically
themed
hotel
upon
staying
here
however
i
am
convinced
that
i
made
the
right
choice
in
my
stay
the
dining
accommodations
were
excellent
and
i
was
served
probably
some
of
the
best
food
igve
ever
eaten
at
a
hotel
it
was
intelligently
placed
in
downtown
chicago
and
i
wouldngt
have
to
walk
too
far
to
see
some
street
performers
or
just
take
in
the
majesty
of
the
city
itself
the
room
i
had
booked
had
an
excellent
view
of
the
skyline
and
i
couldgve
easily
sat
for
hours
just
marveling
at
the
city
sprawled
out
before
me
the
whole
hard
rock
and
musical
aspect
of
the
hotel
was
just
the
icing
on
the
cake
of
my
stay
if
i
had
to
stay
here
again
i
would

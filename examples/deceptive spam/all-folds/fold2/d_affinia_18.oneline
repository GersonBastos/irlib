i
just
came
back
from
this
awesome
terrific
hotel
last
week
and
i
have
to
say
i
loved
it
my
wife
and
i
were
there
for
a
week
due
to
a
business
meeting
and
right
when
i
stepped
into
the
hotel
i
knew
that
this
business
vacation
will
be
well
spent
the
customer
service
was
very
great
and
an
employee
even
guided
us
toward
our
room
we
were
introduced
to
a
fantastically
lit
room
with
beds
a
flat
screen
tv
and
even
free
internet
access
my
wife
loved
it
and
kept
on
using
the
free
shampoo
and
body
bath
soap
when
i
headed
down
to
the
lobby
for
my
conference
i
got
lost
and
asked
one
of
the
people
who
worked
there
where
my
meeting
might
be
held
he
leaded
me
to
the
door
and
i
was
very
impressed
there
is
a
fitness
center
which
i
went
everyday
and
this
great
restaurant
called
c
house
situated
nicely
next
to
the
hotel
lobby
where
i
had
a
nice
steak
and
my
wife
a
salad
all
in
all
i
thought
that
the
trip
was
really
worth
it
and
my
stay
was
very
welcoming
at
the
affinia
chicago
i
highly
recommend
that
whenever
you
visit
chicago
you
should
stay
there
you
will
not
regret
it

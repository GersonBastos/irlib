we
loved
the
talbott
the
location
was
fabulous
very
close
to
the
shopping
the
hotel
is
smaller
but
the
rooms
are
very
nice
they
are
very
spacious
and
are
able
to
be
darkened
to
sleep
well
also
the
beds
are
some
of
the
most
comfortable
i
have
ever
slept
in
i
might
also
add
that
our
room
at
queen
beds
the
staff
is
all
friendly
and
puts
them
themselves
out
for
you
the
hotel
has
a
cute
outdoor
eating
area
on
the
sidewalk
that
has
flowers
etc
it
looks
like
a
scene
out
of
europe
i
would
highly
recommend
the
hotel
we
were
there
with
our
daughtersg
ages
and

ambassador
east
is
an
awesome
hotel
understand
that
this
hotel
is
full
of
history
and
is
a
boutique
hotel
my
family
stayed
at
the
ambassador
for
two
nights
in
a
suite
very
clean
room
with
great
space
the
best
part
of
the
ambassador
is
not
the
rooms
though
the
staff
was
extremely
courteous
especially
the
concierge
if
you
stay
here
you
have
to
go
to
the
pump
room
the
restaurant
is
full
of
nostalgia
the
staff
is
great
and
the
food
is
excellent

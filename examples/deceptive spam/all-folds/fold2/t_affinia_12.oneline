i
travel
a
lot
for
business
and
quite
frankly
my
expectations
were
starting
to
reach
new
lows
i
usually
always
choose
w
hotels
just
for
the
consistency
of
average
hotels
the
affinia
in
chicago
has
raised
my
expectations
and
w
hotels
are
going
to
suffer
in
comparison
this
hotel
is
one
of
the
cleanest
i
have
stayed
at
in
some
time
service
was
impeccable
friendly
front
desk
staff
and
the
extra
towels
i
ordered
arrived
literally
within
minutes
the
gym
has
new
equipment
with
plenty
of
space
and
such
a
fun
vibe
without
dark
hallways
and
loud
music
i
have
to
thank
the
other
reviewers
their
reviews
led
me
to
the
affinia
and
i
was
so
pleased
my
new
chicago
hotel
it
will
even
lead
me
to
try
the
manhattan
hotels

we
loved
our
stay
at
the
talbott
we
were
in
chicago
to
attend
the
theater
show
dirty
dancing
we
booked
our
room
through
orbitz
and
received
a
nice
discount
when
we
arrived
at
the
hotel
everyone
from
the
doorman
to
the
front
desk
to
the
maids
were
highly
professional
and
courtesy
we
were
upgraded
to
a
king
bed
suite
the
suite
was
well
decorated
and
spacious
my
wife
particularily
enjoyed
the
heat
that
could
be
directed
at
the
marble
floor
in
the
bathroom
we
loved
the
hotel
and
will
definitely
stay
at
the
talbott
on
our
next
trip
to
chicago
highly
recommended

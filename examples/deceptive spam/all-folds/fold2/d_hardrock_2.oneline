the
hard
rock
hotel
chicago
is
great
alternative
to
ordinary
hotels
the
hotel
is
decorated
with
a
huge
variety
of
music
memorabilia
that
makes
the
stay
worth
it
alone
the
hotel
is
often
visited
by
many
talented
artists
including
singers
dancers
actors
etc
the
staff
were
very
polite
and
helpful
and
always
pleasant
the
rooms
were
very
clean
and
nicely
decorated
as
were
the
common
areas
and
hallways
i
would
highly
recommend
the
hotel
to
anyone
staying
in
the
area

i
traveled
to
chicago
recently
with
my
giant
german
shepard
dog
rex
and
picked
the
hard
rock
hotel
for
the
perfect
location
and
because
a
close
friend
had
warmly
recommended
their
pet
friendliness
the
service
truly
is
incredible
they
even
had
a
web
cam
so
i
could
check
in
on
rex
while
i
was
out
for
dinner
in
the
evening
and
a
friendly
staff
member
took
him
for
a
walk
when
i
could
not
make
it
home
from
a
meeting
the
day
after
the
rooms
really
rock
pardon
the
pun
nothing
like
the
cheap
plastic
laminated
stained
carpet
decor
so
common
in
other
places
that
allow
pets
the
easy
chair
looked
so
good
that
i
was
almost
afraid
rex
would
snack
on
it
while
i
was
out
but
he
seemed
to
like
the
guitar
chew
toy
that
came
with
the
pet
package
better
i
would
definitely
recommend
the
hard
rock
hotel
to
my
friends
whether
they
travel
with
or
without
pets

wow
where
do
i
start
booked
this
hotel
through
hotels
com
for
less
than
i
paid
for
the
travellodge
downtown
check
in
was
a
breeze
the
entire
staff
was
friendly
and
helpful
our
room
was
huge
the
king
bed
was
very
comfortable
our
room
also
had
nightstands
chairs
with
a
small
table
a
desk
and
walk
in
closet
even
with
all
the
furniture
the
room
was
very
spacious
the
room
did
show
some
signs
of
wear
but
i
think
this
adds
to
the
charm
and
the
rich
history
of
this
hotel
the
hotel
is
located
in
a
neighborhood
so
it
felt
like
we
were
staying
in
a
condo
or
a
home
rather
than
a
hotel
there
is
very
little
noise
however
you
are
only
about
blocks
from
rush
and
division
streets
with
all
the
nightlife
and
the
red
line
at
clark
and
division
is
only
blocks
away
we
decided
to
walk
to
michigan
ave
and
the
next
thing
we
knew
we
were
at
the
hancock
building
by
staying
here
you
are
away
from
the
noise
but
not
away
from
the
action
had
breakfast
at
the
pump
room
which
is
a
story
in
itself
we
had
our
photo
taken
in
booth
take
some
time
and
research
who
has
sat
in
this
booth
it
is
impressive
some
photos
of
celebrity
guests
adorn
the
walls
of
the
pump
room
didngt
have
a
chance
to
have
dinner
here
but
i
will
return
for
dinner
someday
breakfast
was
not
anything
fancy
and
a
bit
pricy
but
the
history
and
experience
was
worth
it
in
my
opinion
the
waitstaff
was
friendly
as
was
everyone
who
worked
at
this
hotel
was
i
cangt
wait
to
return
here

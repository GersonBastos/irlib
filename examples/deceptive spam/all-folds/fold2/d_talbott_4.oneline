at
first
my
husband
and
i
were
really
excited
for
our
family
to
enjoy
the
t
rex
experience
package
we
figured
it
would
be
a
great
deal
package
even
though
the
hotel
itself
felt
too
ritzy
for
us
to
travel
with
our
four
children
but
after
two
nights
of
downtown
chicago
fun
we
realized
that
the
talbott
transcends
itgs
ritzy
look
and
truly
embraces
a
family
friendliness
which
we
thoroughly
enjoyed

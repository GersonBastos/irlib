the
ambassador
east
hotel
in
chicago
is
a
fantastic
up
scale
hotel
to
stay
in
while
visiting
the
windy
city
my
fiancee
and
i
enjoyed
one
of
the
king
rooms
on
our
recent
stay
the
staff
was
exceptionally
friendly
and
helpful
some
of
the
best
igve
ever
dealt
with
when
traveling
and
valet
parking
is
always
a
perk
the
rooms
were
very
nice
and
had
all
the
amenities
you
would
want
when
at
a
high
end
hotel
the
bed
was
extremely
comfortable
there
was
cable
tv
of
course
and
hbo
was
included
so
there
was
always
something
to
watch
wireless
internet
signal
was
excellent
and
i
had
no
trouble
getting
online
we
had
dinner
in
the
hotel
restaurant
twice
during
our
stay
and
the
food
was
fantastic
great
atmosphere
as
well
we
usually
only
do
the
hotel
restaurant
one
night
on
a
stay
but
this
one
was
worth
going
back
to
overall
it
was
an
incredible
stay
and
we
hope
to
stay
at
the
ambassador
east
again
next
time
wegre
in
chicago

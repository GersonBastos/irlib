such
a
great
feeling
every
time
i
had
any
experience
with
a
hotel
staff
member
i
was
so
pleased
i
have
to
say

is
everything
to
me
and
i
have
to
give

added
bonus
was

i
had
a
meeting
down
in
the

person
approached
me
in

asked
if
he
could
help
me

to
my
meeting
i
thought
he
was
getting
me
a
taxi
but
no
he
walked
me
to
his
suv
and
drove
me
to
the
meeting
just
a
free
service
from
the
hotel

stated
as

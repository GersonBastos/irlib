we
booked
rooms
for
nights
on
hotwire
over
labor
day
weekend
we
arrived
at
the
hard
rock
at
around
a
m
and
they
were
able
to
give
us
our
rooms
early
hooray
we
were
on
the
floor
beatles
theme
the
rooms
were
very
comfortable
one
of
our
rooms
was
on
a
corner
and
had
lots
of
windows
the
other
was
was
a
bit
larger
with
fewer
windows
not
a
great
view
from
our
side
of
the
hotel
but
we
didngt
pay
for
a
room
with
a
view
the
beds
and
pillows
were
extremely
comfortable
the
bathroom
was
full
of
aveda
products
and
there
was
a
bathrobe
in
the
closet
the
tv
dvd
stereo
combo
was
nice
but
we
werengt
in
the
room
a
lot
to
use
it
we
were
warned
by
the
front
desk
not
to
even
touch
the
snacks
drinks
as
they
were
weighted
and
wegd
be
charged
no
problems
there
we
did
not
make
use
of
the
free
fitness
center
because
the
weather
was
perfect
my
husband
was
able
to
go
for
a
run
through
grant
park
along
the
waterfront
instead
he
said
it
was
wonderful
we
did
use
the
free
internet
in
our
rooms
it
was
gwired'
internet
but
my
stepdad
said
that
was
better
for
him
anyway
the
room
was
a
bit
dim
at
night
but
we
were
able
to
read
just
fine
using
the
bedside
lamps
there
was
virtually
no
hall
elevator
noise
the
location
of
the
hard
rock
is
ideal
it
is
easy
to
get
breakfast
at
the
corner
bakery
just
blocks
to
either
grant
park
the
art
institute
state
street
shopping
or
michigan
ave
to
sum
up
there
was
absolutely
nothing
to
complain
about
we
would
be
glad
to
stay
here
again
any
time

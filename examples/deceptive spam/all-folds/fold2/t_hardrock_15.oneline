so
my
sweetie
lures
me
out
under
the
guise
of
dinner
at
the
china
grill
upon
arrival
he
tells
me
his
boys
are
watching
the
game
in
a
suite
upstairs
and
want
to
say
hi
we
arrive
at
the
floor
and
my
oh
my
surprise
ladies
and
gentlemen
this
is
something
to
be
admired
spacious
and
roomy
yet
warm
cozy
and
inviting
great
bed
comfortable
furniture
great
inch
plasmas
and
the
views
are
unbelievable
my
only
complaint
a
shower
should
have
a
door
to
keep
the
heat
in
other
than
that
no
complaints
room
service
was
great
morning
coffee
was
yummo
overall
a
fabulous
experience

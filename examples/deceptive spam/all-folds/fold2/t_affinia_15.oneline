i
checked
in
at
the
affinia
hotel
in
chicago
shortly
after
dinner
on
tuesday
i
was
greeted
by
very
frendly
staff
from
the
valet
service
to
front
desk
you
can
tell
people
were
happy
at
the
hotel
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
when
i
got
to
my
room
the
room
was
very
well
decorated
and
well
thought
out
the
furniture
was
in
the
right
location
and
there
was
lots
of
space
plus
it
was
convenient
with
lots
of
power
outlets
the
bedroom
and
washroom
was
very
clean
and
i
had
a
great
sleep
in
their
very
comfortable
bed
i
was
told
by
front
desk
i
could
choose
from
different
pillows
although
i
did
not
take
advantage
of
this
offer
i
thought
what
a
great
idea
once
in
a
while
you
come
across
hotels
with
great
service
well
thought
out
rooms
in
a
perfect
location
right
off
magnificent
mile
when
visiting
chicago
again
i
will
definitely
try
and
stay
at
affinia
again

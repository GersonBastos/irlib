excellent
location
feels
like
a
boutique
hotel
right
next
to
neiman
marcus
v
expensive
dept
store
and
mins
walk
to
john
hancock
tower
as
most
american
medium
to
high
end
hotels
service
was
excellent
from
the
bellhop
to
reception
upgrade
to
a
suite
if
you
are
staying
longer
than
a
couple
of
days
as
walking
around
the
windy
city
can
be
tiring
and
a
suite
feels
like
a
small
apartment
the
pub
in
the
basement
is
good
for
a
sandwich
and
a
beer
they
will
be
refurbing
so
take
adavantage
of
lower
rates
now
as
i
feel
they
will
be
going
for
very
high
end
clients
after
the
remodelling

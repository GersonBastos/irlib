my
stay
at
the
affinia
last
weekend
was
ideal
and
i
cangt
wait
to
return
i
was
in
town
for
a
brief
personal
trip
and
wanted
to
have
a
clean
lovely
room
near
the
shopping
downtown
affinia
fit
the
bill
the
location
was
perfect
just
one
block
from
the
magnificent
mile
the
decor
was
modern
and
sleek
and
my
room
was
impeccably
clean
they
even
have
a
pillow
menu
the
price
was
pretty
reasonable
too
igll
definitely
be
back

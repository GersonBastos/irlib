the
magnificent
mile
in
chicago
is
a
great
place
to
visit
and
staying
at
the
affinia
chicago
just
made
it
that
much
better
the
location
is
awesome
all
of
the
great
shopping
spots
were
just
moments
away
and
getting
to
navy
pier
was
a
cinch
and
the
accommodations
themselves
were
wonderful
the
hotel
lets
you
completely
customize
your
stay
all
the
way
down
to
choosing
your
own
pillow
very
impressed
overall

while
making
the
obligatory
trip
to
the
chicago
area
to
visit
family
we
decided
to
make
it
fun
for
the
teenage
members
of
our
group
and
reserved
a
couple
of
rooms
at
the
hard
rock
hotel
chicago
what
a
great
decision
the
rooms
are
very
upscale
at
a
reasonable
price
with
great
amenities
and
according
the
younger
members
of
the
family
very
cool
we
cangt
wait
to
come
back

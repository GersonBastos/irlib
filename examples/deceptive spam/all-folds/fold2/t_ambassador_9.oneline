we
stayed
at
the
ae
for
two
nights
for
a
three
generation
girls
weekend
grandma
mom
and
daughter
i
looked
at
their
website
for
an
idea
of
rates
and
looked
at
any
packages
that
might
interest
us
then
i
called
the
property
directly
and
was
assisted
by
a
very
gracious
man
named
reece
rates
were
a
bit
high
for
the
saturday
night
portion
of
our
stay
but
when
i
requested
the
american
girl
package
he
was
more
than
happy
to
honor
the
advertised
rate
the
american
girl
package
was
perfect
for
us
my
year
old
daughter
was
thrilled
they
give
you
a
doll
bed
a
backpack
and
a
travel
kit
to
keep
they
have
matching
bathrobes
for
girl
and
doll
you
dongt
get
to
keep
those
she
also
got
a
special
welcome
letter
and
a
complimentary
room
service
snack
from
a
specially
printed
menu
our
room
was
large
and
clean
it
had
two
double
beds
with
nice
linens
two
chairs
a
desk
and
a
clean
bathroom
the
employees
are
all
very
friendly
and
helpful
we
had
a
drink
in
the
pump
room
but
did
not
eat
there
we
ate
breakfast
nearby
at
a
great
place
called
the
coast
this
hotel
is
north
of
michigan
ave

it
is
just
a
short
pleasant
walk
to
the
mag
mile

would
definately
stay
here
again
in
chicago

my
wife
and
i
stayed
two
nights
at
the
talbott
at
the
end
of
february
this
little
hotel
was
the
perfect
place
for
us
the
lobby
is
very
small
but
also
cozy
and
with
both
fireplaces
going
it
was
a
welcoming
atmosphere
coming
in
from
the
cold
the
staff
was
very
friendly
and
efficient
the
room
was
pretty
spacious
and
the
king
bed
was
extremely
comfortable
we
had
a
seventh
floor
room
facing
delaware
st
so
there
was
really
no
view
the
bathroom
was
a
good
size
including
two
sinks
and
a
spacious
tub
shower
there
was
also
free
wireless
internet
a
big
plus
for
us
perhaps
the
best
thing
about
the
talbott
is
the
location
we
were
only
a
few
steps
from
state
rush
and
north
michigan
tons
of
shopping
bars
and
good
food
are
easily
within
walking
distance
this
makes
the
talbott
a
great
place
for
tourists
who
want
to
walk
around
and
take
everything
in
we
highly
recommend
the
talbott
and
will
gladly
stay
again
on
return
trips

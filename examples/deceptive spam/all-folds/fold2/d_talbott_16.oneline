great
hotel
the
staff
is
friendly
corteous
and
professional
they
made
me
feel
like
i
was
a
returning
guest
which
i
was
not
but
i
will
be
the
rooms
were
very
clean
and
i
slept
well
in
the
comfy
bed
they
have
a
complimentary
workout
deal
with
the
nearby
healthclub
that
i
took
advantage
of
several
times
since
it
was
to
cold
to
run
outside
my
only
issue
was
the
battery
for
the
tv
remote
died
however
a
call
to
the
front
desk
remedied
that
situation
in
about
minutes
stars

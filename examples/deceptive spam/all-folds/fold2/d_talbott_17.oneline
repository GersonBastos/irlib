i
really
loved
my
stay
at
the
talbott
my
room
was
amazing
the
bathroom
and
i
am
very
picky
about
hotel
bathrooms
had
ample
room
for
all
of
my
stuff
which
is
a
bonus
for
me
the
staff
treated
me
really
well
and
they
were
very
friendly
i
was
afraid
that
igd
get
a
little
lost
since
it
was
my
first
trip
to
chicago
but
the
staff
helped
me
navigate
to
the
downtown
area
rush
st
michigan
ave
which
are
gvery*
close
by
the
hotel
reminded
me
of
those
igd
stayed
at
in
europe
the
room
service
is
hours
which
for
me
was
a
bonus
because
i
am
up
mostly
during
the
nights
this
is
the
gonly*
place
i
will
ever
stay
if
i
visit
chicago
again
for
a
single
woman
traveling
alone
to
a
strange
city
this
hotel
made
me
feel
very
safe
and
comfortable

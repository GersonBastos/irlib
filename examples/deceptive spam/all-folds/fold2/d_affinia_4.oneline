we
had
the
pleasure
of
enjoying
a
stay
at
the
affinia
chicago
hotel
we
found
it
conveniently
located
on
e
superior
street
near
many
local
attractions
the
rooms
were
modern
chic
with
a
very
urban
feel
the
pillow
menu
was
awesome
my
partner
and
i
have
such
different
preferences
the
choices
made
it
easier
to
sleep
like
we
were
at
home
the
hotel
room
layout
was
comfortable
and
spacious
with
all
the
right
touches
to
make
our
stay
perfect
i
couldngt
believe
the
amenities
available
to
guests
my
beagle
betsy
enjoyed
her
stay
at
the
jet
set
pet
care
center
she
was
pampered
as
much
as
i
was
it
was
such
a
comfort
knowing
we
could
bring
her
along
and
that
we
could
enjoy
our
stay
without
the
stress
and
concern
that
comes
along
with
traveling
and
pet
ownership
another
feature
i
personally
enjoyed
was
the
walking
tour
kit
it
included
an
ipod
shuffle
pre
loaded
with
a
workout
playlist
a
deck
of
cardsg
guidebook
that
included
walking
tours
and
comfort
items
like
a
towel
and
map
i
felt
like
i
was
the
most
important
guest
surely
everyone
felt
that
way
as
they
checked
in
to
their
rooms
highly
recommend
to
anyone
who
has
the
opportunity
to
travel
in
the
area
of
an
affinia
hotel

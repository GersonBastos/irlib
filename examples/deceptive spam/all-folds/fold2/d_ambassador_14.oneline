close
to
all
the
great
sights
of
chicago
like
navy
pier
lake
michigan
and
all
the
fabulous
dining
the
hotel
was
very
classy
and
the
rooms
were
furnished
in
a
traditional
but
cozy
manner
the
entire
family
loved
it
even
the
dog
because
they
are
also
pet
friendly
at
the
ambassador
east
hotel
we
loved
the
restaurant
there
the
pump
room
was
great
something
to
please
even
the
pickiest
of
our
eaters
we
were
there
on
a
family
get

but
asked
to
see
a

the
suites
were
gorgeous

to
tell
our

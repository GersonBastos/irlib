wegve
just
returned
from
a
two
night
stay
at
the
affinia
chicago
and
our
visit
was
delightful
thanks
to
tripadvisor
reviews
we
were
prepared
for
the
major
construction
work
on
the
facade
and
entrance
it
was
a
mess
and
the
hotel
restaurant
and
bar
remain
incomplete
and
unavailable
even
parts
of
the
lobby
had
wet
paint
stickers
all
these
things
could
have
made
for
a
disappointing
stay
not
so
although
we
arrived
very
early
in
the
day
our
suite
was
ready
along
with
a
most
warm
and
gracious
greeting
from
the
front
desk
staff
after
just
a
few
minutes
we
felt
like
we
were
at
home
the
suite
on
the
floor
with
a
fab
view
along
a
wall
of
windows
was
sparkling
fresh
and
clean
the
bathroom
lighting
was
outstanding
and
led
to
my
bride
of
nearly
years
saying
that
it
made
her
look
younger
she
was
right
everything
in
and
about
the
room
was
like
new
and
very
stylish
as
a
visitor
we
appreciated
the
very
convenient
location
just
a
few
steps
from
the
magnificient
mile
and
all
of
its
ambiance
thanks
to
a
dedicated
and
gracious
staff
a
fantastic
location
and
chic
decorating
elements
this
hotel
can
and
will
be
our
future
hotel
of
choice
in
chicago
the
stay
was
short
but
sweet

the
hard
rock
hotel

chicago
has
it
allg
location
comfort
and
rockability
we
stayed
at
the
hard
rock
hotel
in
chicago
recently
and
found
it
to
be
amazing
the
location
was
perfect
as
it
is
walking
distance
to
the
magnificent
mile
navy
pier
and
lake
michigan
it
was
just
a
short
ride
by
bus
or
cab
to
the
sports
stadiums
shedd
aquarium
or
the
museum
of
science
and
industry
the
food
although
it
was
pricey
was
great
there
is
a
spa
on
site
if
you
need
a
little
time
to
relax
and
recoup
after
all
that
rocking
and
if
you
have
pets
they
get
the
royal
treatment
complete
with
gifts
i
would
highly
recommend
the
hard
rock
hotel
of
chicago

i
have
just
returned
from
a
lovely
shopping
trip
to
chicago
it
is
a
very
nice
hotel
and
i
will
love
to
stay
there
if
i
visit
chicago
again
there
is
a
lot
of
positive
to
say
about
the
hotelg
staff
is
excellent
never
experienced
such
an
excellent
service
that
alone
is
worth
coming
back
for
was
pleasantly
surprised
that
the
room
rate
was
including
breakfast
a
few
things
that
could
make
this
hotel
even
better
a
hand
shower
in
the
bathroom
the
hairdryer
to
be
placed
in
the
bedroom
instead
of
the
bathroom
when
the
bathroom
is
all
damp
after
a
shower
i
prefer
leaving
the
bathroom
to
dry
my
hair
free
internet
access
in
the
lobby
i
was
surprised
i
had
to
pay
or
usd
for
minutes
to
log
on
and
check
in
with
my
airline
only
with
a
few
airlines
you
can
check
in
without
paying

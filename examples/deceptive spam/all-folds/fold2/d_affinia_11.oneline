the
affinia
hotel
in
chicago
was
superb
the
room
service
was
exemplary
and
the
food
i
dongt
even
know
were
to
start
the
chef
obviously
knew
what
he
was
doing
i
especially
loved
the
seafood
my
personal
favorite
was
the
shrimp
aside
from
this
i
loved
how
beautiful
the
hotel
was
it
is
definetly
a
bargain
for
the
price
for
that
price
you
would
probably
get
a
good
star
hotel
but
i
felt
as
if
i
was
in
a
a
night
star
hotel
in
the
europe
great
bang
for
your
buck
would
recommend
it
to
anybody
looking
to
relax
at
a
great
hotel
with
great
amenities
in
a
great
city
my
friends
actually
went
their
a
while
back
because
of
me
they
loved
it
i
know
you
will
too

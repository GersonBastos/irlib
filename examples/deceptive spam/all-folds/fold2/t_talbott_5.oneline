i
stayed
at
the
talbott
for
nights
on
business
and
was
very
pleased
the
staff
was
friendly
as
can
be
immediately
confirming
the
lore
of
the
midwest
i
was
upgraded
to
a
suite
which
was
bigger
than
my
apartment
and
certainly
more
luxurious
the
free
wi
fi
came
in
handy
as
i
needed
to
work
remotely
while
there
everything
from
the
comfort
of
the
bed
to
the
staff
and
location
made
this
a
great
stay
oh
and
i
got
to
workout
at
the
huge
equinox
right
next
door
for
free

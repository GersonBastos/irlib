just
returned
from
nights
at
the
ambassador
and
i
have
to
say
that
i
am
very
happy
that
i
chose
this
hotel
it
is
true
that
this
is
an
older
hotel
but
it
is
well
kept
and
it
does
not
lack
in
style
and
grandeur
think
of
the
hotel
from
the
shining
minus
the
elevator
of
blood
and
creepy
twins
from
the
check
in
desk
to
the
surprise
turn
down
service
from
the
maids
i
was
made
to
feel
like
royalty
a
special
acknowledgment
goes
out
to
the
doormen
who
helped
me
with
all
my
tourist
questions
also
the
location
of
the
hotel
is
great
close
to
all
the
action
but
on
a
quite
residential
street
with
beautiful
old
mansions
i
also
got
a
sweet
per
night
room
by
booking
on
travelzoo
that
was
just
an
added
bonus
however
even
if
i
paid
per
night
my
impression
of
the
ambassador
would
not
change
highly
highly
recommended

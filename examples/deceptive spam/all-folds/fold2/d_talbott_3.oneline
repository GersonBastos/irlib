the
atmosphere
at
the
talbott
hotel
is
very
welcoming
when
you
first
walk
in
the
employees
are
friendly
and
will
greet
you
when
you
first
arrive
the
hotel
seems
to
be
luxurious
even
from
the
lobby
and
right
away
i
was
very
excited
for
my
stay
i
stayed
in
a
double
queen
room
with
my
friend
the
room
is
spacious
enough
and
beds
are
very
comfortable
i
didngt
try
the
room
service
but
they
do
have
a
fitness
club
close
by
with
a
spa
which
is
very
convenient
i
also
love
how
the
room
has
individual
climate
controls
very
neat
also
handy
that
there
is
an
ihome
in
the
room
igm
usually
stuck
using
just
a
regular
alarm
clock
radio
at
other
hotels
i
will
most
likely
stay
in
this
hotel
another
time
it
was
a
wonderful
experience

our
stay
at
the
ambassador
east
hotel
was
extremely
relaxing
and
pleasant
we
enjoyed
the
location
we
could
easily
walk
to
the
red
line
or
access
the
bus
lines
along
michigan
avenue
we
felt
safe
walking
along
the
neighborhood
streets
and
viewing
the
fabulous
architecture
that
is
on
n
state
street
and
dearborn
we
walked
to
coast
cafe
the
chicago
history
museum
and
second
city
from
our
hotel
our
room
was
spacious
and
well
kept
and
it
was
quiet
enough
for
us
to
take
a
nap
during
the
afternoon
before
heading
out
again
in
the
evening
we
would
choose
to
stay
there
again
even
if
we
could
afford
more
expensive
locations
downtown
we
definitely
enjoyed
the
neighborhood
feel
of
the
place

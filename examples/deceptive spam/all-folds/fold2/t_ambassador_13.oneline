recently
returned
from
a
two
night
stay
at
ambassador
east
hotel
was
looking
for
a
comfortable
hotel
to
stay
at
while
visiting
family
now
located
in
chicago
mission
was
accomplished
if
you
would
like
a
quiet
comfortable
hotel
in
a
great
area
this
is
it
while
some
of
the
furnishings
show
some
signs
of
their
age
it
does
not
detract
from
the
elegant
style
of
the
rooms
and
adds
to
the
comfortable
and
home
like
feeling
found
staff
to
be
friendly
and
helpful
we
will
be
return
guests
many
times
in
the
future
for
sure

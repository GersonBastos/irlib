i
was
visiting
relatives
in
chicago
and
wanted
to
stay
in
a
hotel
that
emphasized
luxury
and
was
also
environmentally
friendly
and
the
talbott
seemed
to
fit
the
bill
i
also
couldngt
help
but
notice
all
the
positive
reviews
online
i
figured
i
couldngt
go
wrong
and
i
am
happy
to
report
the
positive
reviews
are
true
first
of
all
check
in
was
a
breeze
i
love
their
online
reservation
system
it
was
easy
to
use
and
the
information
presented
was
quick
and
accurate
once
i
arrived
in
chicago
i
was
greeted
by
tim
at
the
door
and
i
immediately
felt
like
wanted
and
liked
the
receptionist
was
very
polite
and
when
she
heard
i
was
visiting
chicago
for
the
first
time
she
upgraded
my
deluxe
king
to
an
executive
king
score
the
room
was
just
as
advertised
luxurious
and
convenient
it
was
also
exceptionally
clean
and
this
is
very
important
to
me
because
i
am
paranoid
of
germs
and
bed
bugs
most
importantly
though
i
got
a
good
nightgs
sleeep
because
the
bed
and
pillows
were
super
soft
but
firm
enough
to
help
support
my
back
i
also
used
the
equinox
fitness
club
and
wow
what
a
club
this
is
another
great
amenity
of
the
talbott
and
easily
beats
other
hotels
skimpy
workout
centers
my
check
out
was
quick
easy
and
painless
this
hotel
gets
my
highest
recommendation
the
facilities
are
immaculate
and
modern
with
the
recent
upgrade
the
staff
is
ultra
friendly
and
competent
and
the
location
was
perfect
for
my
needs

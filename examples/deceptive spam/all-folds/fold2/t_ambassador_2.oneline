in
a
very
nice
location
close
to
shopping
and
places
to
eat
and
also
in
a
beautiful
neighborhood
a
small
hotel
with
a
pleasant
place
to
sit
in
the
lobby
the
pump
room
is
a
classic
place
to
have
a
drink
we
did
not
have
dinner
there
so
i
can
not
comment
but
we
enjoyed
people
watching
while
we
had
an
afternoon
drink
looking
out
the
window
at
the
people
in
the
neighborhood
it
is
a
short
walk
to
very
good
shopping
and
eating

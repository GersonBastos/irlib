i
enjoyed
my
stay
at
the
ambassador
east
hotel
in
chicago
the
staff
was
friendly
and
helpful
from
the
time
i
checked
in
all
the
way
through
checkout
the
hotel
was
very
clean
and
well
maintained
the
beds
were
very
comfortable
the
hotel
restaurant
lounge
was
very
cozy
and
a
nice
way
to
unwind
after
a
long
day
the
only
thing
i
was
unhappy
about
was
the
fact
that
internet
service
is
not
complimentary
at
this
hotel
i
reccomend
this
hotel
and
i
will
stay
there
again
on
my
next
trip
to
chicago

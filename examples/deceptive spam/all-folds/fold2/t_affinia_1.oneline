i
was
completely
blown
away
by
this
hotel
it
was
magnificent
i
got
a
great
deal
and
i
am
so
happy
that
i
stayed
here
before
arriving
i
was
nervous
as
i
had
read
a
few
bad
reviews
about
the
impact
the
renovation
was
having
on
peoples
stay
for
example
very
noisy
however
whilst
the
renovation
was
still
going
on
and
the
gym
was
not
open
nor
the
restaurant
it
made
no
difference
to
me
my
room
was
huge
bathroom
was
spacious
with
excellent
water
pressure
bed
was
perfect
and
the
view
was
amazing
hotel
is
so
close
to
the
great
shops
of
magnificent
mile
plus
a
comfortable
walking
distance
to
hancock
tower
and
millennium
park

this
was
the
best
choice
my
husband
and
i
could
have
chosen
to
visit
the
hotel
has
stunning
views
from
all
around
and
the
best
part
is
that
it
is
near
the
water
i
was
perfectly
happy
to
enjoy
the
luxurious
rooms
and
comfortable
decor
while
my
husband
enjoyed
the
solace
the
found
in
the
free
gym
everything
was
so
clean
and
invoting
especially
the
pump
roomg
there
was
so
much
history
in
one
rooom
overall
we
had
a
great
relaxing
vacation
away
from
the
kids
i
would
definitely
return
to
the
ambassador
next
time
wegre
in
the
area

from
the
moment
i
stepped
into
the
ambassador
east
hotel
i
was
very
much
impressed
the
entire
staff
was
extremely
helpful
and
very
pleasant
the
bell
staff
escorted
my
husband
and
i
right
up
to
our
suite
our
suite
was
beyond
belief
the
atmosphere
was
very
classy
and
romantic
my
husband
previously
arranged
for
a
bottle
of
champagne
to
be
waiting
in
our
room
when
we
arrived
we
had
traveled
to
chicago
from
new
york
for
a
romantic
weekend
get
away
we
had
dinner
that
night
at
the
hotel
restaurant
the
pump
house
and
were
very
pleased
dinner
started
with
soup
and
a
salad
main
course
meal
and
dessert
all
for
a
reasonable
price
we
did
a
little
local
shopping
the
next
day
after
a
very
well
rested
night
in
their
wonderfully
comfortable
king
sized
beds
every
interaction
with
the
staff
was
a
postitive
experience
we
enjoyed
our
weekend
get
away
and
would
most
definitely
return
to
the
ambassador
east
hotel
the
next
time
that

are
in
chicago

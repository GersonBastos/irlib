we
also
just
returned
from
a
frigid
weekend
in
chicago
i
booked
the
ambassador
east
because
of
its
great
rate
with
my
aaa
card
and
we
were
delighted
yes
the
rooms
show
some
signs
of
wear
but
the
warmth
and
charm
far
make
up
for
it
this
was
such
a
pleasant
change
from
the
sleek
modern
look
of
many
other
chain
and
boutique
hotels
we
became
members
of
the
i
preferred
program
and
were
therefore
eligible
for
an
upgrade
which
we
automatically
got
upon
check
in
we
had
a
lovely
suite
with
lots
of
sitting
room
and
a
comfortable
bedroom
and
bathroom
we
had
wonderful
food
at
the
pump
room
which
is
classic
our
oatmeal
there
was
so
tastefully
served
igd
love
to
have
some
right
now
the
location
was
great
had
it
been
normal
winter
weather
we
could
have
easily
walked
to
michigan
avenue
for
shopping
but
due
to
the
minus
degree
windchills
we
opted
for
a
cab
which
was
less
than
a
fare
we
also
enjoyed
a
glass
of
wine
around
the
fireplace
in
the
lobby
and
found
it
so
welcoming
and
cozy
and
not
overcrowed
at
all
we
would
definitely
stay
here
again

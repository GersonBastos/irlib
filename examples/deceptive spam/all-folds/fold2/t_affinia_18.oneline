loved
the

top

member
was
friendly
always
smiling
the

for
michigan
ave
shopping
the
beach
dinner
and
night
life
it
was
a
mile
or
two
from
millenium
station
the
concierge
recommended
a
couple
places
to
hang
out
after
dinner
and
added
our
names
to
the
guest
list
igm
sure
they
do
it
all
the
time
but
still
a
nice
gesture

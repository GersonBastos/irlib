less

minutes
away
our
room
was
immaculate
and
spacious
sq
ft
we
were
told
decorated
in
grays
and
white
the
room
was
comfortable
and
soothing
not
jarring
on
the
other
hand
we
found
the
lighting
to
be
very
poor
and
had
trouble
reading
finding
keys
etc
no
kidding
the
bathroom
was
also
quite
dark
and
it
didnt
have
a
heating
lamp
on
the
positive
side
however
there
were
aveda
products
in
the
bathroom
the
windows
were
huge
so
during
the
day
there
was
tons
of
natural
light
and
no
issues
with
darkness
the
king
size
bed
was
very
firm
but
had
a
plush
pillow
top
which
made
it
very
comfortable
and
inviting
we
had
a
largish
tv
with
a
dvd
player
there
is
a
safe
and
munchies
the
gym
is
perfect
equipped
with
treadmills
ellipticals
bikes

is

and
there
is

are
towels
water
headphones
disposable
ear
pads

suggestiong
if
you
are
on
a
floor
below
the
take
the
elevator
up
to
then
down
to
to
get
to
the
gym
this
way
you
dont
have
to
traverse
the
lobby
the
front
desk
staff
is
amiable
and
very
attentive
i
read
some
other
reviews
about
nasty
personnel
but
did
not
have
that
experience
at
all
i
got
a
free
newspaper
with
a
smile
a
free
stamp
when
i
needed
it
change
and
all
the
coffee
i
could
tolerate
in
the
morning
the
hard
rock
is
located
less
than
a
minute
walk
from
the
water
tower
the
drury
theater
john
hancock
and
magnificent
mile
for
those
who
like
a
thrifty
breakfast
we
recommend
gourmet
pantry
at
n
michigan
avenue
this
deli
made
a
delicious
egg
on
a
toasted
roll
with
butter
on
a
sunday
morning
no
lessg
the
hotel
has
a
breakfast
buffet
for
per
person
but
we
did
not
partake
of
it
we
would
stay
at
the
hard
rock
again
and
think
it
is
great
for
people
with
tweens
not
sure
about
the
toddler
set
though

my
wife
and
i
stayed
at
the
ambassador
east
hotel
for
the
first
days
of
our
honeymoon
in
mid
october
we
decided
to
split
our
honeymoon
up
and
stay
in
two
different
hotels
so
that
we
could
experience
different
aspects
and
areas
of
chicago
in
a
week
igll
start
out
by
saying
that
this
was
a
great
experience
at
check
in
i
indicated
that
we
were
on
our
honeymoon
and
were
upgraded
to
a
suite
the
ambassador
east
is
probably
a
to
minute
walk
from
the
north
end
of
the
magnificent
mile
it
is
also
just
a
or
minute
walk
to
a
lot
of
great
restaurants
and
bars
on
rush
our
room
itself
was
incredibly
spacious
and
well
appointed
our
suite
on
the
floor
had
two
very
large
closets
a
large
living
room
and
a
large
bedroom
the
bed
was
incredibly
comfortable
and
the
bathroom
was
nice
enough
if
i
would
have
payed
full
price
for
this
suite
i
probably
would
have
given
it
a
rating
of
but
because
the
staff
was
so
kind
and
because
my
wife
and
i
had
such
a
great
time
here
i
decided
to
give
it
a
five
it
is
also
worth
mentioning
that
the
concierge
was
very
helpful
my
wife
and
i
decided
to
eat
at
the
pump
room
restaurant
but
we
were
not
very
impressed
we
found
the
food
and
service
mediocre
the
atmosphere
was
probably
pretty
neat
when
sinatra
used
to
eat
there
back
in
the
day
but
not
anymore
although
we
were
unimpressed
by
the
pump
room
the
staff
were
kind
enough
to
seat
us
in
the
sinatra
booth
which
was
back
in
a
corner
and
enclosed
by
curtains
that
neat
experience
was
really
the
only
redeeming
value
of
our
meal
here
the
ambassador
east
is
an
older
hotel
but
it
is
in
a
charming
older
neighborhood
the
staffgs
kindness
and
overall
charm
of
the
hotel
itself
really
impressed
my
wife
and
me
when
we
are
in
chicago
again
we
will
definitely
consider
staying
at
the
ambassador
east
again

i
had
a
large
roomy
clean
bed
room
with
a
large
bathroom
big
minibar
snack
assortment
and
was
tucked
away
nicely
in
the
corner
so
that
there
was
no
hall
noise
customer
service
here
was
absolutely
incredible
from
the
doorman
to
the
front
desk
to
the
gentleman
who
delivered
my
toothpaste
to
my
room
when
i
requested
it
sure
you
get
a
little
outside
noise
but
it
is
a
big
city
that
is
not
unusual
i
really
enjoyed
my
stay
here
and
strongly
recommend
it

when
i
planned
my
summer
vacation
i
was
wanting
to
travel
somewhere
new
chicago
was
on
my
mind
because
of
the
fast
city
life
i
got
in
a
flight
to
chicago
and
arrived
at
the
hard
rock
hotel
it
was
grand
and
i
spent
a
total
of
days
and
nights
there
the
luxury
was
exotic
and
the
location
was
right
around
the
corner
from
most
shopping
and
dining
venues
the
room
service
had
me
drooling
because
the
food
was
so
delicious
i
could
hardly
picture
not
feeling
satisfied
i
met
up
with
a
few
of
my
friends
and
they
offered
me
a
tour
around
town
i
enjoyed
the
stay
there
and
will
come
back
sooner
than
later

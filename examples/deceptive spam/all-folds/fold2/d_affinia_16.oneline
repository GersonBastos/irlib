we
recently
completed
our
first
visit
to
chicago
and
were
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
affinia
chicago
hotel
where
we
stayed
the
hotel
has
gone
to
great
lengths
to
offer
extra
services
to
their
guests
including
individual
pillow
choices
complimentary
kits
with
items
designed
to
enhance
the
city
visit
and
fine
dining
in
two
on
site
restaurants
one
of
them
roof
top
with
amazing
city
views
i
would
recommend
this
hotel
to
anyone
visiting
chicago

i
got
married
in
the
chicago
area
this
passed
weeknd
and
my
guests
all
stayed
at
the
ambassador
east
hotel
they
had
nothing
but
nice
things
to
say
about
it
my
husbands
mother
is
terribly
picky
about
where
she
stays
and
this
hotel
met
her
needs
the
rooms
are
decorated
so
nicely
and
they
dongt
have
that
funny
hotel
smell
the
pump
room
was
a
fun
place
for
the
men
to
hang
and
watch
sports
if
igm
ever
in
the
area
again
i
will
be
sure
to
book
a
room
at
the
ambassador
east
hotel

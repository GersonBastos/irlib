i
recently
stayed
at
the
hard
rock
hotel
in
chicago
while
in
town
for
business
and
enjoyed
my
stay
very
much
i
stayed
in
a
room
with
a
king
bed
which
was
very
comfortable
the
room
had
all
the
things
i
needed
for
my
stay
which
was
nice
the
only
thing
is
i
think
there
was
a
party
on
my
floor
but
they
quieted
down
quickly
enough
my
room
even
had
an
internet
connection
i
also
had
dinner
one
night
at
the
china
grill
and
it
was
an
amazing
meal
overall
i
had
a
great
stay
and
will
return
next
time
i
am
in
chicago

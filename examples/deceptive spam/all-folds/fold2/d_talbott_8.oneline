my
stay
at
this
hotel
was
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
had
the
location
service
and
accommodations
were
all
outstanding
the
lobby
area
is
beautiful
as
was
my
room
in
the
room
there
was
more
than
enough
space
which
is
difficult
to
find
in
chicago
hotels
my
only
gripe
was
the
room
was
a
little
dark
sure
staying
at
a
small
upper
class
hotel
like
the
talbott
involves
paying
a
premium
but
it
was
well
worth
it
the
service
was
timely
and
everyone
seemed
friendly
and
informed
the
room
service
took
a
bit
longer
than
i
would
have
liked
however
the
food
was
good
quality
another
nice
touch
was
the
gym
pass
provided
for
guests
at
the
equinox
fitness
center
finally
the
location
is
perfect
itgs
located
in
a
beautiful
area
of
the
city
near
the
gold
coast
which
has
many
very
good
restaurants
a
personal
favorite
of
mine
is
mariogs
a
nice
italian
place
nearby
overall
my
experience
at
the
hotel
was
good
and
while
it
had
some
minor
flaws
they
were
for
the
most
part
insignificant

i
have
to
say
that
the
hard
rock
hotel
in
chicago
is
a
cool
place
to
stay
when
i
first
got
there
getting
checked
in
was
very
fast
the
lady
at
the
counter
was
nice
and
well
spoken
the
bellhop
had
out
bags
into
the
room
very
fast
the
room
was
very
hip
and
cool
there
was
musical
items
all
over
the
place
i
really
loved
the
beatles
art
that
was
in
my
bathroom
after
being
in
the
room
a
few
minutes
i
got
a
call
from
the
front
desk
asking
me
if
i
liked
my
room
they
also
asked
me
if
i
would
be
interested
in
things
like
spa
treatments
and
or
if
i
needed
to
use
their
business
room
i
needed
some
things
shipped
while
i
was
there
which
they
had
supplies
to
help
me
with
that
after
getting
some
work
done
i
called
the
concierge
if
there
was
some
really
good
pizza
places
around
they
gave
me
information
for
awesome
places
i
left
and
came
back
after
having
a
night
out
on
the
town
they
were
very
understanding
that
i
was
a
wee
bit
out
of
it
i
had
more
than
pizza
that
night
if
you
get
my
drift
when
i
got
back
to
my
room
the
bed
was
so
comfortable
i
feel
right
off
to
sleep
and
had
a
good
nights
sleep
in
the
morning
i
order
breakfast
which
was
really
a
philly
cheese
steak
they
will
make
anything
you
want
anytime
of
day
i
checked
out
by
with
my
bags
feeling
rested
and
very
relaxed
thank
you
hard
rock
you
rock

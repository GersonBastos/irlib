i
enjoyed
my
stay
at
the
talbott
hotel
it
is
on
the
more
expensive
side
but
it
is
all
worth
it
i
got
the
talbott
tradition
package
which
was
for
two
people
and
included
a
breakfast
credit
on
check
out
day
the
rooms
are
huge
the
beds
are
soft
and
comfortable
they
include
aveda
bath
products
which
is
a
plus
in
my
book
they
also
have
a
nice
fitness
area
pool
you
can
use
while
you
stay
there
one
thing
i
thought
was
really
cool
is
that
you
can
forward
your
messages
from
your
hotel
room
phone
to
your
cell
phone
my
boyfriend
also
liked
the
ihome
audio
system
the
location
of
this
hotel
is
very
convenient
as
well
its
close
to
several
great
restaurants
and
blocks
from
the
coast
but
what
i
like
best
about
this
hotel
is
that
they
make
an
honest
effort
to
not
negatively
impact
the
environment
more
than
they
need
to
they
were
one
of
the
first
hotels
to
be
green
sealed
overall
i
had
a
great
stay
at
talbott
hotel

my
girlfriends
and
i
stayed
nights
at
the
talbott
returning
home
on
saturday
we
all
had
a
wonderful
time
and
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
hotel
the
staff
from
top
to
bottom
were
excellent
accommodating
the
room
was
roomy
with
our
only
complaint
being
not
being
able
to
cool
the
room
fast
enough
after
a
day
on
the
town
the
construction
next
door
was
obstructing
the
sidewalk
but
being
on
a
oneway
street
limited
that
difficulty
the
doorman
andrew
was
an
excellent
source
at
this
hotel
he
arranged
all
our
transportation
at
night
to
restaurants
we
enjoyed
everything
about
the
hotel
and
the
city
the
hotel
was
expensive
but
met
expectations

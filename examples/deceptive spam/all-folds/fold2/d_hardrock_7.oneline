staying
at
the
hard
rock
hotel
is
one
of
best
bets
you
can
ever
make
while
traveling
i
stayed
at
this
one
the
last
time
i
visited
chicago
and
it
was
just
wonderful
the
rooms
are
amazing
and
the
one
i
stayed
in
had
a
great
view
of
the
city
the
beds
were
comfortable
and
everything
was
really
clean
and
neat
the
wi
fi
was
really
fast
and
always
available
and
i
liked
the
fact
that
you
could
get
a
guitar
at
the
front
desk
and
jam
in
your
own
room
with
a
pair
of
headphones
i
didngt
have
the
chance
to
use
the
spa
but
i
could
tell
it
was
really
nice
and
relaxing
i
did
go
to
the
base
bar
a
couple
times
for
a
drink
very
cool
atmosphere
and
great
drinks
to
choose
from
the
rock
shop
was
pretty
cool
too
and
i
bought
a
bunch
of
shirts
to
bring
back
home
to
family
and
friends
overall
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
coolest
hotels
you
could
stay
in
the
experience
is
definitely
different
than
any
other
hotel
igve
stayed
in

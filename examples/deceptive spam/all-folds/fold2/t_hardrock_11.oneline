just
putting
in
a
good
word
for
the
hard
rock
hotel
in
chicago
the
reviews
i
read
before
going
were
mixed
so
we
were
not
sure
what
to
expect
the
location
was
perfect
the
hotel
was
beautiful
our
view
was
awesome
the
room
was
large
enough
and
very
clean
the
bed
was
very
comfy
the
staff
were
helpful
especially
the
concierge
jared
i
couldngt
find
anything
negative
to
say
if
you
want
to
stay
in
downtown
chicago
you
cangt
go
wrong
with
this
cool
hotel

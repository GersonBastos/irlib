set
up
an
important
meeting
for
some
clients
at
the
hard
rock
hotel
chicago
they
were
flying
to
chicago
for
a
special
trip
to
checkout
the
music
scene
and
to
discuss
business
with
my
company
naturally
they
wanted
to
stay
here
the
client
really
seemed
to
like
their
rooms
but
felt
the
paul
reed
smith
room
was
too
cramped
for
our
day
long
meeting
sq
ft
in
a
panic
i
contacted
the
hrh
staff
and
they
actually
had
another
bigger
room
available
we
quickly
moved
our
meeting
in
the
birdland
room
for
the
rest
of
the
day
and
the
meeting
was
a
rousing
success
birdland
room
is
sq
ft
we
have
a
new
client
and
so
does
hrh
this
is
where
the
client
wants
to
stay
every
time
they
fly
in
for
future
business
meetings
with
us

my
husband
and
i
recently
stayed
at
your
hard
rock
hotel
in
chicago
and
what
a
fantastic
experience
it
was
we
stayed
in
one
of
the
gextreme
suitesg
and
let
me
tell
you
it
was
beautiful
the
furniture
and
paintings
were
amazing
and
the
view
was
to
die
for
the
staff
treated
us
really
well
and
met
all
of
our
needs
and
then
some
i
especially
loved
the
spa
we
stayed
for
a
week
but
i
could
have
stayed
a
lot
longer
it
was
very
comfortable
and
welcoming
we
will
make
sure
to
recommend
your
hotel
to
our
friends
and
will
be
back
the
next
time
we
are
in
chicago
thanks
so
much

was
my
first
time
at
the

and
i
reserved
a
king
size
suite
inside
my
room
there
was
nice
view
of
chicagogs
gold
coast
i
really
needed
to
get
some
work
done
for
my
business
trip
and
this
room
was
perfect
for
the
situation
i
could
easily
relax
on
my
king
size
bed
i
watch
hbo
on
a
enormous
size
flat
screen
tv
for
free
also
when
i
did
do
my
work
there
was
nice
wooden
desk
in
my
room
with
a
desk
lamp
and
wifi
modem
it
so
nice
to
have
my
laptop
with
me
and
able
to
use
it
on
a
good
workstation
in
my
room
after
finishing
my
work
i
have
time
to
check
the

from
their
pump

a
out
hotel

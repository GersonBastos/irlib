my
husband
and
i
came
to
the
ambassador
east
hotel
for
my
sistergs
wedding
the
hotel
had
been
very
helpful
and
professional
in
helping
us
coordinate
a
wedding
with
over
guests
when
we
arrived
we
were
impressed
by
how
organized
they
were
helping
us
check
and
get
our
guests
situated
they
were
even
nice
enough
to
let
us
leave
guest
gift
bags
in
each
of
our
guestgs
rooms
our
rooms
were
clean
and
beautifully
appointed
with
a
view
of
the
city
we
held
the
rehearsal
dinner
groomsman
party
in
the
pump
room
which
has
a
gorgeous
bar
complete
with
celebrity
photos
on
the
wall
after
my
sister
was
married
in
a
church
downtown
we
held
the
reception
in
the
large
banquet
hall
again
the
hotel
was
great
about
shuttling
all
of
our
guests
and
helping
us
arrange
dinner
the
dj
and
all
of
the
weddinggs
decorations
we
had
a
great
time

as
others
have
said
once
all
the
construction
works
are
completed
i
suspect
that
the
prices
this
hotel
can
legitimately
charge
will
put
it
out
of
our
price
range
which
will
be
a
pity
because
it
is
an
excellent
hotel
the
location
couldngt
be
better
the
room
was
very
spacious
with
separate
sitting
study
areas
a
nice
bathroom
only
minor
pointsg
downstairs
they
were
serving
a
free
basic
breakfast
coffee
pastries
but
we
only
knew
of
it
on
our
last
morning
nobody
had
mentioned
thisg
the
cost
of
internet
is
a
bit
dear
especially
when
lots
of
motels
now
offer
it
freeg
there
was
only
powered
milk
in
the
rooms
which
wasngt
that
nice
but
none
of
these
really
spolied
a
really
enjoyable
stay

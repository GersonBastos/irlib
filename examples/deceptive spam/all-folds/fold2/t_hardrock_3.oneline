the
hard
rock
is
glossy
and
sexy
but
an
absolutely
fantastic
hotel
i
was
in
town
for
business
and
stayed
here
because
of
itgs
location
but
i
absolutely
understand
why
tourists
would
like
it
right
on
the
river
cool
art
deco
building
and
millenium
park
is
just
down
the
street
regardless
the
room
was
clean
the
staff
was
friendly
but
not
annoying
and
the
bar
was
fun
i
was
comfortable
having
a
couple
of
drinks
alone
at
the
end
of
the
day
they
were
good
igll
definitely
try
it
again

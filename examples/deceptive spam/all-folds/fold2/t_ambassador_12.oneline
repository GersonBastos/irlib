my
stay
at
the
ambassador
east
was
great
the
hotel
is
in
a
great
location
in
the
charming
gold
coast
neighborhood
of
downtown
chicago
gave
me
the
feeling
of
staying
in
a
chicago
neighborhood
vs
the
concrete
jungle
of
downtown
but
the
magnificent
mile
and
rush
street
are
just
a
few
blocks
from
the
front
door
the
staff
was
very
friendly
also
really
enjoyed
having
drinks
in
the
historic
pump
room
they
had
a
live
band
on
saturday
and
i
really
enjoyed
looking
at
the
pictures
of
the
celebrities
throughout
the
lounge
that
visited
from
years
gone
by
definitely
recommend
it

upon
arriving
to
the
hard
rock
hotel
in
chicago
i
was
immediately
impressed
the
staff
was
friendly
and
checked
us
in
quickly
which
is
important
to
me
after
a
long
trip
our
room
was
immaculate
and
decorated
in
a
clean
modern
style
the
bed
was
very
comfortable
including
the
linens
which
felt
high
quality
unlike
what
you
get
at
some
other
hotels
all
this
made
for
a
great
night
sleep
perhaps
the
most
impressive
part
of
our
stay
at
the
hard
rock
hotel
was
their
party
like
a
rottweiler
package
we
added
to
our
reservation
for
an
additional
fee
we
were
able
to
bring
our
pet
and
were
provided
with
treats
toys
and
best
of
all
the
pet
cam
we
left
our
dog
in
the
room
with
a
pet
cam
and
were
able
to
watch
him
throughout
the
day
on
my
iphone
all
in
all
this
was
a
great
place
to
stay
and
igd
highly
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
wants
to
travel
with
their
pet

i
loved
staying
at
the
hard
rock
hotel
in
chicago
not
only
is
it
an
amazingly
friendly
atmosphere
but
they
give
me
the
option
to
bring
my
pet
with
me
they
are
a
dog
friendly
hotel
it
costs
a
night
for
the
dog
to
stay
with
you
but
that
beats
the
costs
of
paying
a
kennel
to
keep
or
your
dog
or
a
neighbor
to
watch
them
for
you
i
loved
this
option
they
also
give
your
animals
a
gift
bag
filled
with
treats
food
bowls
and
doggy
clean
up
bags
i
higly
reccomend
this
hotel
if
you
are
looking
for
a
place
to
bring
your
four
legged
friend
with
you
when
you
travel

the
hard
rock
hotel
was
a
natural
choice
for
me
to
book
a
block
of
rooms
for
several
colleagues
traveling
into
chicago
the
location
is
fantastic
a
short
walk
to
top
notch
city
points
of
interest
such
as
lake
michigan
millennium
park
and
art
museum
and
several
fantastic
restaurants
nearby
to
choose
from
my
co
works
loved
the
exterior
of
the
building
views
from
the
rooms
the
art
on
the
walls
and
crisp
clean
hip
feeling
of
the
hotel
but
not
too
over
the
top
for
business
by
far
a
better
experience
than
your
usual
chain
hotel
where
they
shuffle
you
in
and
out
and
boring
rooms
here
you
feel
special
for
the
same
price
the
lobby
and
bar
have
fun
cozy
areas
to
just
hang
out
and
watch
the
people
pass
on
michigan
ave
or
catch
a
real
rock
star
in
the
lobby

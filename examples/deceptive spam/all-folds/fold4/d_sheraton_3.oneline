i
stayed
at
the
sheraton
chicago
hotel
for
two
nights
and
i
must
say
the
service
they
rendered
was
quite
impressive
they
had
very
attentive
and
friendly
staff
members
the
room
that
i
stayed
in
was
spacious
for
me
and
my
husband
their
hotel
restaurant
served
the
most
delicious
steaks
i
have
tasted
i
ordered
a
classic
fillet
mignon
and
it
was
cooked
to
perfection
i
would
definitely
stay
at
this
hotel
again
if
ever
i
come
back
to
chicago
and
would
absolutely
highly
recommend
this
to
my
friends
and
family

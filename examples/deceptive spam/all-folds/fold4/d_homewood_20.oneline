my
stay
at
the
homewood
suites
was
absolutely
one
of
my
greatest
stays
away
from
home
the
locations
right
in
the
heart
of
downtown
chicago
within
the
river
north
shopping
district
i
love
to
shop
so
that
was
what
i
needed
magnificent
room
layouts
with
kitchen
the
room
was
fully
equipted
with
anything
i
needed
nice
flat
screen
along
with
a
breakfast
buffet
and
a
fantastic
complimentary
dinner
and
wine
after
dinner
and
wine
i
enjoyed
the
comfort
of
the
heated
indoor
pool
so
relaxing
i
would
recommend
these
suites
to
everyone
i
know

i
just
enjoyed
a
day
weekend
at
the
swissotel
chicago
a
friend
of
mine
booked
it
and
got
a
great
rate
cheaper
than
even
a
fleabag
motel
so
keep
an
eye
out
for
specials
the
view
was
great
the
location
was
prime
the
staff
was
helpful
the
room
was
large
we
had
double
beds
i
only
have
one
complaint
our
room
was
next
to
some
sort
of
storage
or
mechanical
room
where
employees
i
think
would
sneak
off
to
talk
on
the
phone
the
sound
came
right
though
the
vent
in
our
bathroom
and
we
could
hear
them
plain
as
day
fortunately
the
sound
was
only
in
the
bathroom
so
it
wasngt
like
it
kept
us
up
at
night
it
was
just
a
little
weird
overall
a
great
stay
and
i
will
definitely
stay
there
again

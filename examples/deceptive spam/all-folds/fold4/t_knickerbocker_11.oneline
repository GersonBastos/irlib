we
absolutely
loved
the
knickerbocker
now
if
you
expect
your
hotels
to
be
cookie
cutter
comfortable
forget
this
place
if
holiday
inns
are
like
the
rows
of
housing
developments
in
the
suburbs
the
knickerbocker
is
like
those
beautiful
old
houses
in
the
center
of
the
city
the
location
is
great
the
hotel
bar
is
cozy
and
classy
and
the
rooms
feel
like
guest
bedrooms
in
victorian
mansions
for
the
price
you
simply
cangt
do
any
better
than
this
in
downtown
chicago

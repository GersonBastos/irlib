my
sister
and
i
went
to
chicago
for
a
weekend
and
decided
to
stay
at
this
hotel
because
i
have
a
friend
who
works
at
homewood
suites
here
in
cleveland
so
we
got
a
discount
the
valets
were
really
friendly
you
get
in
and
out
service
when
you
pay
for
parking
with
the
hotel
check
in
is
on
the
floor
because
there
are
restaurants
beneath
the
hotel
at
street
level
that
also
made
finding
the
hotel
tricky
because
i
expected
a
groove
to
pull
into
and
it
turned
out
that
i
just
had
to
pull
over
to
the
right
side
of
the
street
the
lady
at
the
front
desk
was
friendly
and
informative
our
room
was
very
clean
the
fact
that
it
is
an
extented
stay
hotel
was
nice
when
it
came
to
bringing
home
leftovers
from
restaurants
storing
and
reheating
food
the
complimentary
breakfast
was
great
they
have
real
food
such
as
eggs
bacon
french
toast
cereal
bagels
juice
milk
and
yogurt
the
hotel
is
in
walking
distance
from
everything
and
there
is
a
trolley
that
goes
to
navy
pier
and
passes
by
michigan
avenue
they
also
have
free
wifi
overall
i
would
definately
stay
here
again
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
others

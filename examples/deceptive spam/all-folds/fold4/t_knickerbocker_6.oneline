ok
we
are
back
from
the
knickerbocker
and
i
would
give
it
the
best
rating
i
cangt
believe
the
bad
reviews
i
got
a
priceline
deal
and
i
still
got
a
fine
room
clean
up
to
date
furnishings
ok
a
little
traditional
for
my
taste
and
smoke
free
someone
said
in
another
thread
that
some
people
write
prank
reviews
i
think
such
people
should
get
a
life
because
people
want
to
read
the
truth
here
it
is
from
my
point
of
view
both
rooms
on
floor
regarding
the
size
of
the
rooms
we
had
two
rooms
one
was
a
double
bed
room
it
was
about
x
each
double
bed
had
valences
that
were
kind
of
mini
canopies
the
furniture
bathroom
tile
shower
no
tub
wall
paper
and
paint
had
been
done
in
the
last
few
years
a
chinese
inspired
cabinet
held
tv
coffeemaker
ice
bucket
and
mini
bar
three
separate
levels
tv
ice
coffee
and
minibar
the
other
room
was
called
queen
executive
this
one
had
queen
bed
with
more
of
a
canopy
than
valence
sofabed
two
tvs
and
terry
bathrobes
also
about
the
same
size
but
different
configerations
one
tv
faced
the
bed
other
in
the
three
level
cabinet
the
sofabed
smoke
in
the
lobby
there
is
a
bar
to
the
right
of
the
entrance
it
is
an
open
arrangement
so
that
i
am
sure
the
smoke
comes
from
bar
to
entrance
door
no
smoke
smell
in
no
smoking
rooms
cost
of
rooms
on
priceline
plus
taxes
very
good
value
one
block
from
n
michigan
ave
only
complaint
concierge
said
that
the
free
trolley
didngt
go
down
michigan
ave
to
field
museum
museum
complex
when
in
fact
it
does
was
this
ignorance
or
trying
to
throw
more
business
to
taxi
either
case
not
good
he
said
at
this
time
of
year
free
trolley
only
goes
to
navy
pier
during
winter
which
is
clearly
incorrect

the
homewood
suites
is
one
of
my
favorite
hotels
in
chicago
it
is
a
great
place
to
stay
as
a
family
the
last
time
my
family
and
i
visited
chicago
we
stayed
and
picked
the
shedd
aquarium
package
what
an
amazing
time
the
aquarium
is
great
and
we
saved
a
lot
of
money
by
buying
this
package
i
also
appreciated
that
fact
that
our
room
had
a
kitchen
with
two
really
picky
children
it
was
so
nice
to
be
able
to
cook
or
at
least
to
have
the
option
we
also
enjoyed
the
many
neat
facilities
in
the
homewood
suites
chicago
downtown
nice
pool
great
workout
room
breakfast
buffet
and
the
wine
and
beer
dinner
in
the
evening
i
wouldngt
stay
anywhere
else
when
i
visit
the
windy
city

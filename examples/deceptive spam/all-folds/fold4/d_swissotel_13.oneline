everything
you
would
would
expect
from
a
top
notch
hotel
and
exceeded
by
the
service
the
trendy
decor
and
easy
to
access
dining
gave
us
a
gsecond
windg
pick
up
after
a
day
of
sight
seeing
this
hotel
is
definitely
the
place
that
i
want
to
come
back
to
by
the
time
we
left
after
days
and
nights
my
wife
and
i
wished
we
had
more
time
to
enjoy
the
restaurant
a
few
more
times
and
the
delightful
swiss
flare
one
of
the
things
we
enjoyed
the
most
was
seeing
the
water
from
our
window
the
feeling
of
being
pampered
can
only
come
from
the
very
gracious
hotel
staff
and
this
hotel
is
number
in
my
mind

when
we
were
stranded
in
chicago
for
two
days
since
our
flight
home
was
canceled
our
airline
put
us
in
touch
with
hotels
com
who
found
us
the
room
at
the
sheraton
towers
after
a
long
and
frustrating
day
that
ended
up
with
us
still
in
chicago
arriving
at
the
sheraton
was
a
joy
the
entire
staff
was
wonderful
the
bell
staff
was
great
helping
us
finally
let
go
of
the
heavy
bags
jonathan
at
check
in
was
very
helpful
and
had
us
in
a
room
which
he
upgraded
for
us
in
no
time
we
enjoyed
the
location
and
the
facilities
of
this
property
during
our
unexpected
stay
and
would
highly
recommend
this
location
to
others
we
cangt
say
enough
about
the
staff
if
we
are
in
chicago
in
the
future
we
will
definitely
return
here

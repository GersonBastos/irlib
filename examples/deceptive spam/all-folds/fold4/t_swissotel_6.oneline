the
best
service
the
staff
here
was
incredible
you
never
had
to
lift
a
finger
the
room
was
huge
as
hotel
rooms
go
the
view
was
phenomenal
location
great
what
a
great
weekend
we
did
stop
for
a
drink
at
the
palm
restaurant
and
unfortunately
it
closes
at
p
m
too
bad
the
lobby
lounge
is
open
later
but
drinks
costs
twice
as
much
as
the
bar
at
the
palm

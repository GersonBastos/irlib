we
stayed
here
as
an
alternative
spot
for
a
friendgs
wedding
the
price
was
about
to
of
what
it
costs
to
stay
at
similar
hotels
in
the
area
first
the
minuses
the
standard
rooms
are
small
if
you
want
a
little
more
space
you
might
want
to
upgrade
since
the
hotel
has
been
recently
rehabbed
you
can
see
some
of
the
stuff
that
the
covered
or
painted
there
really
are
no
views
from
the
hotel
now
the
plusses
the
shower
is
awesome
probably
one
of
the
best
hotel
showers
igve
seen
rain
shower
with
wand
great
pressure
and
the
enclosure
didngt
leak
like
a
lot
of
these
shower
stalls
do
very
nice
the
fixtures
and
finishes
in
the
rooms
were
top
notch
very
modern
and
clean
the
bed
was
great
better
than
some
hotels
that
promote
their
beds
great
nights
sleep
overall
this
is
a
great
space
for
a
trip
where
you
are
not
going
to
be
spending
much
time
in
the
room
if
you
were
in
town
for
a
conference
or
for
work
where
you
will
need
to
spread
out
your
stuff
it
might
not
work
anyone
else
should
really
like
the
experience
all
i
care
about
when
i
travel
is
having
a
nice
bed
and
a
good
shower
to
relax
in
after
a
long
day
if
you
are
the
same
this
is
a
good
spot
for
you

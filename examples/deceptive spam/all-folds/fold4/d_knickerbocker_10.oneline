it
was
my
first
time
to
visit
chicago
and
i
would
say
igd
definitely
go
back
not
just
because
of
the
air
and
water
show
that
we
really
enjoyed
but
most
importantly
because
of
the
hotel
that
we
stayed
in
the
millennium
knickerbocker
is
not
just
accommodating
to
their
human
guests
but
with
pets
too
at
first
i
was
reluctant
that
they
will
give
us
accommodations
because
of
my
pet
dog
but
i
was
surprised
it
turned
out
the
other
way
igve
experienced
being
denied
reservations
because
of
my
dog
and
thatgs
really
frustrating
itgs
just
nice
that
there
still
are
other
hotels
that
are
pet
friendly
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
hotel
to
my
friends
if
they
plan
to
visit
chicago

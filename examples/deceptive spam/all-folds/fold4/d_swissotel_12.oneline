stays
here
while
on
a
business
trip
in
chicago
first
off
the
staff
were
very
friendly
and
helpful
they
were
knowledgeable
about
the
things
in
the
area
when
i
needed
to
find
something
i
had
a
king
bed
room
it
was
very
clean
and
cozy
and
the
view
was
great
this
is
definitely
a
hotel
i
will
stay
at
again
if
my
work
takes
me
back
to
chicago

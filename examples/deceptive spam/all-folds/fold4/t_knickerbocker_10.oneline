my
first
trip
back
to
chicago
in
about
years
was
perfect
i
chose
the
knickerbocker
as
i
had
read
that
their
rooms
were
recently
renovated
on
top
of
being
a
great
location
to
michigan
avenue
rush
street
and
downtown
chicago
i
must
say
i
was
very
impressed
with
the
guestrooms
i
had
not
stayed
there
prior
but
it
definitely
is
a
refresh
from
what
igve
seen
in
photogs
posted
on
the
reviews
the
guestrooms
are
nicely
decorated
with
a
modern
feel
and
they
are
good
sized
for
a
historical
hotel
the
beds
are
wonderful
i
need
to
get
a
pillow
top
mattress
at
home
i
used
the
internet
access
with
no
issue
and
i
loved
the
larger
screen
tvgs
the
shower
is
fun
with
the
different
types
of
shower
heads
you
can
choose
and
the
bathrooms
are
fresh
with
all
new
granite
and
tile
igm
anxious
to
get
back
to
chicago
and
it
wongt
be
years
from
now
i
would
highly
recommend
this
hotel
fantastic
guestrooms
location
and
staff
igve
added
some
digital
pictures
of
my
room
as
they
are
completely
different
from
the
onegs
i
saw
on
previous
reviews
with
the
new
renovation

to
whom
this
may
concern
my
name
is
jamie
brown
and
i
was
a
recent
guest
of
yours
between
july
through
july
and
your
staff
made
my
stay
so
comfortable
i
almost
didnt
want
to
leave
the
kitchen
in
the
room
and
the
complimentary
grocery
shopping
service
made
me
rethink
leaving
all
together
and
when
i
didnt
feel
like
cooking
the
complimentary
welcome
home
dinner
with
a
glass
of
wine
helped
me
clear
my
mind
for
all
the
paper
work
i
had
to
look
forward
to
the
free
wireless
internet
access
both
in
my
room
and
sitting
by
the
pool
helped
get
all
that
done
and
helped
me
get
my
laps
in
as
well
i
really
couldngt
have
asked
for
anything
more
i
felt
like
a
queen
and
i
never
though
i
could
feel
that
way
just
staying
in
a
hotel
i
thank
you
so
very
much
for
treating
me
so
kindly
and
i
will
gladly
be
visiting
you
again
very
soon
only
for
more
pleasure
and
way
less
business
sincerely
yours
jamie
brown

i
loved
it
here
my
boyfriend
and
i
booked
this
hotel
online
and
were
a
little
worried
what
it
would
be
like
since
we
paid
next
to
nothing
for
our
nights
here
igve
paid
more
to
stay
at
the
santa
barbara
motel
gorgeous
hotel
great
staff
fun
bar
lounge
area
and
we
were
most
impressed
with
the
room
the
large
windows
in
the
bathroom
were
the
best
i
took
a
bubble
bath
one
night
while
looking
at
the
views
of
navy
pier
and
the
skyline
i
remember
thinking
this
is
really
living
the
room
was
comfortable
and
quiet
again
with
great
views
just
like
in
the
bathroom
chicago
is
a
wonderful
town
i
have
nothing
but
good
things
to
say
about
it
cangt
wait
to
come
back

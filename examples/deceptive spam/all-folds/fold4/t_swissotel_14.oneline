a
great
hotel
we
used
the
cta
the
days
we
were
in
chicago
and
it
is
great
that
the
line
stops
nearly
in
front
of
the
hotel
so
we
did
not
need
any
taxi
and
traveled
from
midway
to
the
city
and
to
ohare
for
and
we
used
the
buses
alot
freezing
cold
the
hotel
itself
is
great
very
clean
rooms
realy
on
of
the
best
bathrooms
i
ever
had
staff
very
friendly
they
even
found
me
out
were
i
can
get
timerland
shoes
and
she
was
right
i
got
them
in
one
place
she
told
me
thats
service
i
also
was
having
a
look
to
the
gym
room
and
the
swimming
pool
area
did
not
use
it
and
i
do
not
know
if
it
would
have
been
included
in
the
room
price
but
realy
a
nice
view
makes
running
easyer

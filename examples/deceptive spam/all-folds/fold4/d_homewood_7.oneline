i
travel
often
and
whenever
i
travel
i
prefer
to
stay
at
hilton
properties
i
am
always
satisfied
with
my
stay
at
hilton
locations
however
i
have
never
stayed
at
a
homewood
suites
location
this
property
was
awesome
and
it
was
great
to
have
the
same
satisfication
when
i
arrived
the
lobby
area
was
excellent
and
the
greeting
from
the
front
desk
staff
was
wonderful
my
room
was
in
great
condition
absolutely
no
complaints
i
just
figured
that
a
property
like
this
should
be
recognized
great
job
staff
i
will
definitely
return
in
the
future

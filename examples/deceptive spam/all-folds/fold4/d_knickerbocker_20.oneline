i
accompanied
my
husband
on
a
business
trip
to
chicago
back
in
september
and
we
stayed
at
the
millennium
knickerbocker
hotel
the
place
was
absolutely
oozing
with
old
fashioned
charm
also
there
were
plenty
of
shopping
opportunities
within
walking
distance
so
i
shopped
while
my
husband
worked
it
just
doesngt
get
any
better
than
that
i
loved
the
service
we
received
and
the
ambiance
of
that
grand
old
hotel
and
igd
definitely
stay
there
again

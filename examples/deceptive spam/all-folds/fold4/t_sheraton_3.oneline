this
is
a
great
hotel
the
views
are
fabulous
the
service
it
friendly
and
the
location
is
superb
we
booked
a
room
on
an
upper
floor
and
had
access
to
the
lounge
where
breakfast
and
snacks
were
available
with
picture
perfect
views
of
the
chicago
river
the
only
negative
is
that
the
ceilings
in
the
hall
and
room
are
low
and
can
make
you
feel
a
little
cramped
we
booked
our
room
for
a
night
for
memorial
day
weekend
it
was
a
steal
i
highly
recommend
this
hotel
to
anyone
and
will
be
returning

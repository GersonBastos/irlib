i
really
enjoyed
staying
at
this
hotel
the
separated
living
room
and
bedroom
made
it
feel
like
i
was
renting
a
nice
furnished
apartment
instead
of
a
hotel
room
the
kitchen
was
a
comfort
since
i
could
prepare
a
meal
for
myself
if
i
wished
and
the
refrigerator
and
microwave
was
a
must
since
i
never
finish
my
meals
when
i
go
out
to
eat
i
felt
more
at
ease
here
rather
than
the
detatched
feeling
i
have
with
most
hotels
i
would
recommend
staying
at
this
hotel
if
you
want
to
feel
comfortable
and
welcome
in
a
sophisticated
atmosphere

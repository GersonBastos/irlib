this
is
one
of
my
favorite
sheratons
starwood
properties
i
have
stayed
at
a
lot
of
hotels
mostly
starwood
in
chi
but
all
around
this
is
my
favorite
based
on
cost
amenities
and
downtown
location
i
really
like
it
beginning
with
unloading
the
taxi
because
i
am
greeted
by
nick
who
has
been
there
for
years
he
gives
the
best
greeting
from
la
to
ny
and
is
always
happy
he
obviously
loves
his
job
people
at
the
front
desk
are
always
nice
and
efficient
if
you
like
to
workout
roberta
runs
their
fitness
center
another
one
who
loves
their
job
and
serves
guests
well
great
lake
river
view
while
working
out
on
this
particular
trip
i
was
caught
in
a
pinchg
however
christy
the
former
mgr
was
able
to
take
care
of
a
frequent
guest
i
considered
it
a
minor
miracle
based
on
hotel
availability
the
maids
on
floor
were
very
friendly
and
efficient
another
great
experience

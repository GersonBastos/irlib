upon
entering
homewood
suites
i
was
greeted
by
incredibly
friendly
staff
and
my
breath
was
taken
by
the
beauty
of
the
hotel
when
i
saw
my
room
i
was
immediately
relieved
because
it
provided
all
of
the
amenities
needed
for
my
week
long
business
stay
refrigerator
microwave
stove
dishwasher
flat
panel
tv
best
of
all
the
hotel
has
an
on
site
fitness
center
where
i
was
able
to
work
off
all
of
the
extra
calories
i
consumed
during
the
delicious
complimentary
breakfast
i
couldngt
resist
their
omelettes
the
hotel
is
in
the
heart
of
chicago
and
i
must
say
the
city
view
from
my
room
was
priceless

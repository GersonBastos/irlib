as
a
frequent
traveler
for
both
business
and
pleasure
clean
and
comfortable
accommodations
at
a
reasonable
price
are
important
to
me
homewood
suites
chicago
provides
all
of
that
and
more
the
room
was
spacious
and
immaculately
kept
with
all
the
tools
you
could
need
to
prepare
a
meal
in
the
full
sized
kitchen
after
a
busy
work
day
it
was
wonderful
to
be
able
to
kick
back
in
front
of
the
huge
flat
screen
television
to
relax
with
a
spectacular
backdrop
of
the
city
outside
i
will
definitely
book
a
room
next
time
in
chicago
and
igll
definitely
continue
to
stay
at
homewood
suites
in
other
cities

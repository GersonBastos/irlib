i
was
completely
unfamiliar
with
chicago
but
needed
a
place
to
stay
while
my
husband
worked
there
for
a
few
days
and
we
picked
the
sheraton
chicago
hotel
and
towers
based
solely
on
their
internet
site
wow
did
i
get
lucky
this
is
a
beautiful
hotel
with
all
of
amenities
i
could
have
hoped
for
terrific
food
and
within
walking
distance
of
several
interesting
places
including
the
art
institute
of
chicago
ashley
at
the
concierge
desk
was
particularly
helpful
at
guiding
a
chicago
newbie
to
the
best
places
to
eat
ands
to
see
i
will
heartily
recommend
the
sheraton
chicago
hotel
and
towers

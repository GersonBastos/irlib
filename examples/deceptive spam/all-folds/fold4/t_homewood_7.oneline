perfect
location
clean
and
courteous
staff
all
added
up
to
a
great
stay
its
in
an
area
with
plenty
of
stores
the
mile
and
restaurants
hotel
lobby
is
on
the
floor
and
the
elevator
to
get
there
was
annoyingly
slow
but
overall
i
would
highly
recommend
this
place
regardless
if
your
there
with
a
family
friends
or
on
business
the
subway
to
wrigley
is
a
block
away
from
the
front
door

i
stayed
at
the
millennium
knickerbocker
for
nights
while
on
a
business
trip
as
it
was
conveniently
located
a
few
blocks
away
from
the
office
i
was
visiting
and
just
about
everything
else
for
that
matter
the
lobby
was
absolutely
beautiful
and
the
staff
was
beyond
courteous
and
extremely
helpful
the
rooms
were
elegant
and
spacious
and
i
instantly
felt
right
at
home
the
large
flat
screen
tv
as
a
nice
touch
and
tv
options
were
many
i
headed
downstairs
to
the
bar
for
a
drink
and
was
amazed
at
how
well
kept
it
was
as
well
as
how
nice
everybody
was
as
this
was
my
first
time
i
asked
the
bartender
about
the
area
around
and
he
gave
me
great
advice
about
some
places
to
check
out
all
in
all
this
was
a
great
experience
and
next
time
igm
in
the
area
i
will
definitely
be
staying
here
igd
recommend
the
millennium
knickerbocker
to
anyone
traveling
to
chicago

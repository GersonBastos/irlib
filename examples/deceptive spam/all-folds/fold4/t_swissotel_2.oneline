this
was
our
third
trip
to
chicago
this
year
we
love
the
city
every
time
we
stay
at
a
different
downtown
hotel
swissotel
was
definitely
our
favourite
when
we
come
back
in
july
to
see
the
play
wicked
for
the
second
time
we
will
be
again
at
swissotel
no
more
need
to
try
other
hotels
the
location
is
good
because
it
is
between
the
financial
district
and
the
magnificent
mile
the
room
was
spotless
and
quiet
the
view
amazing
and
those
elevators
were
so
fast
comfortable
beds
friendly
service
not
as
many
noisy
sirens
we
even
watched
the
navy
pier
fireworks
from
our
bed
this
was
the
best
anniversary
ever
we
would
recommend
swissotel
to
everyone

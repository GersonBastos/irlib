i
stayed
for
just
one
nite
at
the
sheraton
hotel
and
towers
and
was
a
little
nervous
after
reading
a
few
negative
reviews
from
other
ta
posters
but
i
was
not
let
down
i
got
the
room
via
pl
and
was
first
placed
in
a
room
on
the
floor
with
a
fabulous
view
of
the
roof
of
the
lobby
and
a
parking
lot
since
i
had
nothing
to
lose
i
asked
to
be
moved
to
a
room
with
a
view
the
front
desk
attendant
rasheeda
wanted
to
make
sure
that
the
room
i
had
at
first
was
clean
and
was
in
order
and
i
assured
her
that
it
was
she
then
moved
me
up
to
the
floor
with
ease
and
it
took
about
minute
i
was
quite
surprised
as
i
have
heard
that
they
treat
pl
and
hotwire
folks
with
a
little
less
love
than
full
price
customers
the
new
room
was
very
clean
and
spacious
and
overlooked
the
navy
pier
a
few
other
skyrise
condos
and
the
beautiful
infinity
of
lake
michigan
all
this
for
yep
i
skipped
room
service
and
walked
to
the
local
gourmet
market
as
suggested
by
others
and
it
was
pricey
but
all
food
there
was
delicious
the
room
was
comfy
had
an
ample
closet
and
room
to
breathe
as
well
as
a
convenient
internet
connection
location
i
didnt
use
it
since
i
wasnt
staying
that
long
but
at
least
it
was
on
the
desk
the
bed
and
pillows
were
very
comfy
but
i
awoke
at
about
in
the
morning
sweating
from
the
comfy
but
very
warm
and
somewhat
weighty
duvet
on
the
bed
this
was
a
great
deal
for
the
price
and
i
would
absolutely
stay
here
again

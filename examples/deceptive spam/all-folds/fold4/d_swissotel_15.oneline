my
family
and
i
recently
attended
a
wedding
in
chicago
and
stayed
at
the
swissotel
it
was
much
nicer
than
we
expected
we
are
used
to
staying
at
mid
class
hotels
and
this
by
far
was
one
of
the
nicest
places
wegve
stayed
the
beds
were
so
comfortable
and
the
crib
the
provided
for
my
infant
son
was
great
quality
i
was
concerned
that
we
would
get
a
rickety
crib
the
bed
sheets
were
so
soft
that
i
wanted
to
take
them
home
we
will
definitely
go
back
to
this
hotel
the
next
time
we
are
in
chicago

having
booked
the
hotel
directly
with
the
hotel
on
its
website
i
arrived
tired
from
ireland
to
find
that
they
had
mislaid
my
booking
and
had
no
room
on
that
night
but
did
have
rooms
for
the
rest
of
the
week
they
booked
me
in
to
another
not
as
nice
downtown
hotel
and
paid
for
my
taxi
to
that
hotel
and
for
that
nights
accommodation
on
my
return
to
the
hotel
next
day
i
was
upgraded
to
the
club
level
what
really
impressed
me
was
that
the
hotel
did
everything
they
could
to
make
up
for
their
earlier
mistake
unprompted
of
course
the
hotel
itself
particularly
on
the
floor
is
excellent
i
will
definitely
be
back

if
you
have
not
tried
the
millennium
knickerbocker
for
a
stay
in
chicago
do
it
now
we
have
stayed
and
enjoyed
at
the
drake
intercontinental
and
others
but
we
always
now
come
back
to
the
knickerbocker
why
if
charlie
the
doorman
is
on
duty
and
you
pull
up
he
will
welcome
you
hegll
probably
ask
your
name
why
because
he
wants
to
call
you
by
your
name
every
time
he
will
see
you
during
your
visit
somehow
he
even
lets
the
other
employees
know
your
name
and
all
of
a
sudden
doorman
receptionist
bellman
waiter
are
referring
to
you
by
name
the
employees
are
what
makes
this
hotel
yes
it
has
everything
to
offer
like
all
hotels
but
the
others
dongt
have
the
fine
people
including
the
cleaning
staff
these
folks
have
try
it
you
will
like
it
we
look
forward
to
our
next
visit
already

the
swissotel
chicago
was
by
far
the
best
hotel
i
have
ever
stayed
at
in
chicago
it
was
clean
modern
and
the
staff
were
very
friendly
even
to
our
large
family
with
cranky
kids
at
a
very
late
hour
the
room
was
fantastic
and
you
can
not
beat
it
for
the
price
not
only
was
the
room
fantastic
but
so
was
the
view
our
room
looked
out
over
the
skyline
and
it
was
breathtaking
especially
at
night
the
best
part
of
the
hotel
was
its
location
it
was
located
within
walking
distance
to
so
many
fun
attractions
including
navy
pier
and
the
sears
tower
our
stay
was
wonderful
and
we
cangt
wait
to
go
back
again

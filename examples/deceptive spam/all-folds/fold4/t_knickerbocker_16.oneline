the
knickerbocker
hotel
is
fantastic
itgs
an
old
hotel
with
updated
rooms
so
you
get
the
old
timey
charm
and
fresh
comfort
all
at
once
the
hotel
has
a
fabulous
location
itgs
a
one
minute
walk
to
the
cheesecake
factory
and
bloomingdales
and
about
a
minute
walk
to
einstein
bagel
company
the
best
bagels
and
cream
cheese
ever
macys
and
saks
this
location
cangt
be
beat
yougre
at
one
end
of
the
magnificent
mile
so
it
makes
for
easy
strolling
as
you
dongt
start
in
the
middle
and
then
backtrack
the
hotel
staff
are
super
helpful
and
friendly
checking
in
and
out
was
very
smooth
and
the
concierge
cheryl
was
amazing
she
booked
all
our
dinner
reservations
and
activities
for
us
and
recommended
an
incredible
restaurant
called
carmines
which
was
a
minute
walk
it
was
the
greatest
italian
restaurant
i
have
ever
been
to
and
i
cangt
recommend
it
more
the
rooms
are
small
but
not
too
small
we
had
a
beautiful
big
samsung
flat
screen
cordless
phones
a
rain
shower
ample
clean
towels
and
beautiful
marble
countertops
the
hotel
rooms
have
european
charm
to
them
and
made
me
feel
like
i
was
at
a
star
hotel
in
europe
the
beds
are
very
comfortable
and
the
duvet
is
soft
like
butter
the
only
complaint
i
had
was
that
housekeeping
woke
us
up
at
one
morning
when
the
knocked
on
our
door
despite
the
fact
that
we
had
the
do
not
disturb
sign
on
when
we
answered
and
asked
her
to
come
back
later
she
seemed
a
bit
miffed
the
issue
was
corrected
though
and
it
didngt
happen
again
during
our
night
stay
the
hotel
has
some
unique
items
on
their
room
service
menu
ie
grilled
cheese
with
mini
tomato
soup
for
dipping
very
cute
their
late
night
menu
however
is
lacking
it
would
have
been
nice
to
see
some
soup
on
there
that
being
said
i
rarely
order
from
room
service
when
on
vacation
so
i
really
dongt
see
that
being
a
big
deal
overall
i
would
recommend
this
hotel
without
hesitation
i
think
we
paid
about
a
night
and
i
would
say
it
was
worth
far
more
than
that
we
had
a
wonderful
experience
and
i
truly
look
forward
to
staying
there
again
wouldngt
stay
anywhere
else

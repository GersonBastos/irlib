my
wife
i
celebrated
our
anniversary
at
the
knickerbocker
could
not
have
been
treated
better
before
we
were
out
of
our
cab
our
bags
had
been
loaded
on
a
cart
we
were
walked
into
the
hotel
by
a
doorman
the
rooms
were
well
appointed
the
entire
hotel
staff
was
very
friendly
this
is
a
prime
location
for
shopping
sightseeing
or
nightlife

the
swisshotel
is
awesome
very
high
class
it
is
expensive
but
so
is
every
hotel
in
chicago
it
is
off
from
the
dingy
areas
of
our
city
yet
a
long
walk
to
navy
pier
so
you
will
need
to
pay
for
the
cab
note
to
all
the
magnificent
mile
is
boring
as
can
be
i
live
in
chicago
and
the
hotel
is
a
better
experience
than
the
mile
of
navy
boring
pier

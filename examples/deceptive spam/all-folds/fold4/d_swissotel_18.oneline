we
enjoyed
our
stay
at
the
swissotel
in
downtown
chicago
it
was
elegant
classy
and
the
service
was
impeccable
it
was
very
family
friendly
for
us
with
the
spacious
rooms
the
kidgs
room
and
the
no
smoking
policy
we
were
just
a
short
walk
away
from
shopping
and
entertainment
and
the
whole
family
enjoyed
the
virtual
city
tour
that
helped
us
decide
what
we
wanted
to
see
the
food
was
delicious
and
we
didngt
have
to
go
outside
the
hotel
to
find
good
food
when
visiting
chicago
again
we
will
come
back
it
was
a
luxurious
experience
at
a
reasonable
price

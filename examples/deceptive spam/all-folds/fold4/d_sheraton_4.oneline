the
sheraton
chicago
hotel
and
towers
was
everything
you
could
ask
for
in
a
hotel
it
was
meticulously
clean
very
orderly
but
still
perfectly
warm
and
comforting
the
rooms
are
very
big
and
spacious
and
the
beds
are
so
soft
itgs
like
heaven
i
didngt
test
out
the
room
service
but
igm
sure
it
would
be
just
like
everything
else
perfect
the
hotel
staff
are
just
so
nice
there
was
a
spectacular
view
from
my
room
and
looking
out
over
the
city
at
night
is
so
magical
there
are
resturants
that
are
easy
to
access
from
the
hotel
and
i
especially
recommend
shulags
steak
house
overall
i
had
a
fantastic
stay
at
the
sheraton
hotel
and
i
would
definitely
stay
there
again

i
stayed
at
the
sheraton
chicago
hotel
and
towers
a
couple
nights
ago
the
service
was
excellent
as
soon
as
i
stepped
through
the
door
they
grabbed
my
bags
and
were
helping
me
choose
the
best
hotel
room
for
me
i
loved
there
service
and
the
room
was
gorgeous
i
highly
recommend
it
for
anyone
and
there
prices
arengt
as
bad
as
others
i
loved
the
experience
and
igm
sure
next
time
igm
in
the
area
igll
visit
again

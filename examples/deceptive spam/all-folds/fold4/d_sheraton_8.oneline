i
stayed
at
the
sheraton
chicago
hotel
and
towers
for
three
days
while
i
was
in
chicago
on
business
this
was
quite
possibly
the
best
hotel
experience
that
i
have
ever
had
which
says
a
lot
considering
the
fact
that
i
stay
in
hotels
quite
frequently
the
staff
was
extremely
friendly
and
very
accommodating
they
made
sure
that
i
had
absolutely
everything
that
i
could
want
or
need
their
friendliness
came
across
in
a
very
genuine
manner
not
fake
or
forced
like
some
employees
can
be
the
room
itself
was
to
die
for
the
bedding
was
so
soft
and
the
room
was
extremely
clean
and
well
kept
i
cannot
speak
highly
enough
about
the
quality
of
the
mattress
and
bedding
because
of
the
mattress
and
bedding
i
got
the
best
three
nights
of
sleep
igve
ever
had
the
views
of
downtown
chicago
were
absolutely
amazing
from
my
room
the
way
the
city
lights
sparkled
stole
my
heart
and
almost
made
me
want
to
move
to
chicago
the
food
was
amazing
also
i
made
it
a
point
to
eat
at
all
three
of
the
hotelgs
restaurants
and
visit
the
bar
while
i
was
there
my
favorite
restaurant
of
the
three
was
shulags
steak
house
the
chi
bar
the
hotelgs
bar
was
amazingly
designed
and
the
drinks
were
great
all
in
all
i
would
rate
my
experience
a
out
of
there
is
nowhere
else
in
downtown
chicago
that
compares
to
the
sheraton

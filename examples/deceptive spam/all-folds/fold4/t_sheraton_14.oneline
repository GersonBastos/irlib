the
sheraton
was
a
wonderful
hotel
when
me
and
my
mom
flew
in
we
were
really
tired
so
we
decided
to
take
a
quick
nap
we
didnt
want
to
get
up
the
beds
are
absolutely
to
die
for
i
wanted
to
take
it
home
with
me
the
service
was
great
and
this
was
probably
one
of
the
biggest
if
not
the
biggest
hotel
ive
ever
stayed
in
they
had
a
really
nice
restaurant
inside
with
excellent
food

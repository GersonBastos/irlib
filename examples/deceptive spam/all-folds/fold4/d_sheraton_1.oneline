my
family
and
i
stayed
here
while
we
were
visiting
chicago
this
was
a
perfect
location
to
many
of
the
things
we
wanted
to
do
and
was
easy
to
get
around
it
was
in
a
safe
neighborhood
and
was
great
accomodations
the
staff
was
friendly
and
went
the
extra
mile
to
make
sure
we
had
everything
we
needed
the
beds
were
comfortable
we
would
definitely
stay
here
again

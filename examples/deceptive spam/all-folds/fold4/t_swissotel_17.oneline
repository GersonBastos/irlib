i
thought
the
swissotel
was
a
great
hotel
the
rooms
were
very
spacious
and
clean
especially
for
downtown
chicago
standards
most
importantly
the
rooms
were
quiet
i
never
heard
people
in
the
hallways
when
i
was
trying
to
sleep
the
only
downside
was
that
the
beds
were
not
anything
special
sure
like
all
hotels
in
chicago
this
hotel
caters
to
wealthy
and
or
business
clients
with
ridiculous
minibar
and
parking
price
however
if
you
are
aware
of
that
prior
to
arrival
its
not
a
big
deal
ie
finding
a
different
place
to
park
the
car
bringing
our
own
snacks
for
the
room
it
would
be
nice
though
if
hotels
such
as
the
swissotel
had
a
microfridge
in
the
room
for
guest
use
staff
was
very
helpful
bellmen
instantly
got
cabs
upon
request
and
the
front
desk
was
efficient
and
helpful
overall
if
i
can
get
a
good
rate
again
igll
stay
at
the
swissotel
the
next
time
i
am
in
chicago

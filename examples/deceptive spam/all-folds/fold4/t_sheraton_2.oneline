i
booked
this
via
priceline
and
was
not
sure
igd
like
it
as
some
sheratons
have
fallen
off
the
cliff
this
hotel
absolutely
surpassed
my
expectations
despite
booking
with
priceline
i
was
treated
like
a
king
they
let
me
check
in
early
gave
me
a
beautiful
room
and
even
went
so
far
as
to
look
up
my
starwood
number
so
i
could
get
some
credit
for
the
stay
the
staff
was
unfailingly
pleasant
the
property
immaculate
and
the
room
very
comfortable
i
highly
recommend
this
hotel

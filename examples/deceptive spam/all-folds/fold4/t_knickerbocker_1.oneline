i
was
very
happy
with
my
stay
at
the
knickerbocker
the
room
were
nice
and
the
staff
was
excellent
i
was
able
to
stay
here
for
per
night
thru
priceline
that
was
an
incredible
bargain
in
my
opinion
this
hotel
is
very
nice
it
has
an
excellent
location
just
off
of
michigan
ave
all
of
the
best
shopping
in
chicago
can
be
found
right
around
the
corner
itgs
a
great
location
very
close
to
many
great
attractions
if
there
is
any
negative
it
would
be
that
there
is
no
swimming
pool
but
i
think
that
is
common
with
a
lot
of
the
older
hotels
in
chicago
i
would
definately
recommend
this
place
hopefully
i
will
be
able
to
stay
there
again
in
the
future

my
nieces

i
stayed
here
for
a
long
weekend
we
had
a
wonderful
time
we
arrived
early
around
and
they
let
us
into
our
room
this
was
very
nice
otherwise
we
would
have
had
to
store
our
luggage
and
register
later
room
was
very
clean
as
was
the
bathroom
with
women
we
needed
extra
towels
they
brought
them
up
right
away
and
then
we
got
a
call
to
make
sure
they
were
delivered
room
was
also
quiet
construction
going
on
behind
us
and
we
never
heard
anything
beds
comfy
and
so
were
the
quilts
good
location
for
michigan

in
all

wonderful
stay

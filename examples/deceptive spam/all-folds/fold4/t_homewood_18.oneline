i
visited
chicago
with
my
two
teenage
daughters
homewood
suites
is
amazing
the
complimentary
breakfast
and
receptions
offer
so
much
variety
the
hotel
was
within
walking
distance
to
many
places
to
eat
and
shop
we
got
caught
in
a
thunderstorm
and
got
soaking
wet
i
dried
all
our
clothes
in
the
dryer
right
in
the
hotel
the
homewood
suites
was
so
much
like
home
the
suite
was
very
spacious
and
had
everything
we
needed
the
hotel
had
lots
of
brochures
and
suggestions
for
dining
and
activities
the
staff
was
so
friendly
and
helpful
chicago
is
an
amazing
place
and
the
homewood
suites
is
the
place
to
stay
i
would
definitely
stay
there
again

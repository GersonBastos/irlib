our
third
stay
at
the
homewood
suites
chicago
proved
to
be
just
as
great
as
the
previous
two
the
staff
are
consistently
friendly
polite
and
professional
and
this
applies
whether
they
are
working
at
the
front
door
servicing
the
rooms
managing
the
breakfast
room
or
on
the
reception
desk
they
genuinely
seem
happy
to
be
working
here
and
cangt
do
enough
for
their
guests
the
rooms
are
large
and
clean
and
seem
to
have
good
insulation
from
each
other
we
didngt
hear
a
thing
from
our
neighbours
and
the
hotel
was
quite
busy
the
hotel
is
well
placed
for
walking
to
the
shops
on
michigan
ave
or
catching
a
bus
or
subway
there
is
a
jewel
osco
and
a
trader
joes
each
within
a
couple
of
blocks
which
are
perfect
for
stocking
up
on
groceries
etc
my
husband
heartily
recommends
gbinnies
beverage
depotg
for
a
huge
variety
of
beer
now
all
we
need
is
an
excuse
to
return
to
chicago
next
year
then
we
can
make
it
four
years
on
the
run
at
the
homewood
suites
because
we
wouldngt
stay
anywhere
else

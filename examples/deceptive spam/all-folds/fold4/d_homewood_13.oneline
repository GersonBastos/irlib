very
nice
hotel
better
than
expected
the
hot
breakfast
is
great
in
the
morning
but
the
dinner
at
night
goes
above
and
beyond
even
free
wine
the
rooms
are
pretty
good
size
well
furnished
and
clean
i
liked
the
view
from
my
room
i
used
the
fitness
center
and
although
did
not
have
everything
i
would
have
liked
was
adequate
i
will
say
the
pool
is
really
nice
and
offers
a
pretty
sweet
view
the
staff
was
friendly
and
helpfulg
being
my
first
time
in
chicago
they
were
able
to
point
me
in
the
right
direction
and
saved
me
some
frustration
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
hotel

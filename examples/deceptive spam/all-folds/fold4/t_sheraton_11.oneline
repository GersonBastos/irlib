we
stayed
at
the
sheraton
by
navy
pier
the
first
weekend
of
november
and
were
very
pleased
with
the
accommodations
and
the
service
we
were
upgraded
to
club
level
rooms
and
stayed
in
and
adjoining
the
view
from
both
rooms
was
spectacular
as
you
can
tell
from
the
picture
attached
they
also
left
a
plate
of
cookies
and
treats
in
the
kids
room
upon
check
in
which
made
us
all
feel
very
special
the
hotel
is
central
to
both
navy
pier
and
michigan
ave
so
we
walked
trolleyed
and
cabbed
all
around
the
area
we
ate
the
breakfast
buffet
both
mornings
and
thought
it
was
pretty
good
the
eggs
were
a
little
runny
but
they
happily
made
a
different
batch
for
us
at
the
omelet
station
our
six
year
old
ate
free
and
our
two
eleven
year
olds
were
instead
of
the
adult
the
rooms
were
clean
the
concierge
reception
staff
were
both
friendly
and
helpful
we
will
definitely
visit
this
sheraton
again
when
wegre
in
chicago
next
time

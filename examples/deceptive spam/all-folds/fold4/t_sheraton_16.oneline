my
husband
teenage
son
and
myself
stayed
at
this
hotel
last
august
we
were
transferred
there
by
tour
operator
who
had
sent
us
to
a
terrible
hotel
on
the
other
side
of
chicago
when
i
complained
i
asked
for
us
to
be
transferred
to
the
sheraton
which
they
arranged
for
us
i
have
stayed
at
many
hotels
in
my
life
and
this
has
been
the
best
the
room
although
i
know
it
was
not
the
largest
was
beautiful
and
very
clean
with
every
amenity
you
needed
it
also
had
superb
views
of
the
river
and
the
lake
the
entrance
hall
to
the
sheraton
is
so
imressive
as
is
the
leisure
centre
in
fact
all
areas
are
fantastic
the
best
thing
about
the
hotel
though
was
the
staff
from
the
bellboy
to
the
receptionists
the
dining
staff
to
the
concierge
each
one
was
courteous
and
so
very
helpful
one
of
the
conciergies
spent
fifteen
minutes
on
the
phone
trying
to
locate
a
specific
pair
of
trainers
for
my
son
above
and
beyond
the
call
i
would
say
i
cannot
reccomend
this
hotel
highly
enough
the
breakfast
buffet
cost
about
dollars
each
but
you
could
eat
as
much
as
you
like
and
take
as
long
as
you
like
which
we
did
it
lasted
us
all
day
if
you
have
the
choice
of
where
to
stay
i
think
you
will
enjoy
the
sheraton
we
did

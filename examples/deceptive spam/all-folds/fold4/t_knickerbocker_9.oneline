i
was
lucky
enough
to
get
a
star
hotel
off
of
priceline
for
i
was
luckier
that
i
got
the
knickerbocker
from
check
in
to
check
out
the
hotel
staff
was
extremely
helpful
and
friendly
the
rooms
are
small
but
cozy
after
reading
the
reviews
from
other
guests
i
was
somewhat
scared
of
what
i
would
find
they
must
have
stayed
at
a
different
hotel
i
am
a
very
frequent
traveler
and
felt
that
the
rooms
and
the
hotel
met
the
star
rating
yes
the
rooms
and
bathrooms
were
small
but
what
historic
hotel
in
a
big
city
isngt
the
decor
and
quality
met
my
expectations
the
lobby
and
bar
were
very
inviting
overall
i
would
stay
here
again
and
again

i
stayed
at
the
millennium
knickerbocker
hotel
for
a
total
of
three
days
and
through
out
my
stay
i
had
a
wonderful
time
the
room
was
impeccably
clean
as
well
as
the
pillows
and
sheets
the
beds
were
large
and
extremely
comfortable
the
staff
though
in
my
honest
opinion
is
what
made
my
stay
so
pleasant
from
the
people
at
the
check
in
to
the
waiters
at
the
restaurant
i
got
the
best
customer
service
the
hotel
was
also
conveniently
located
it
was
within
walking
distance
to
the
shopping
center
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
hotel
to
anyone
staying
at
around
the
area
in
chicago

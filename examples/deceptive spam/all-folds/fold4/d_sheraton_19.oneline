we
were
hungry
and
tired
when
we
checked
into
the
chicago
sheraton
the
nice
clerk
at
the
front
desk
got
us
checked
in
efficiently
and
with
a
warm
smile
he
made
us
dinner
reservations
at
shulags
giving
us
time
to
shower
and
change
and
arranged
for
a
bellhop
to
take
our
bags
up
to
the
room
for
us
what
service
we
enjoyed
our
steaks
and
the
bottle
of
wine
that
was
recommended
by
the
waiter
at
shulags
truly
a
lovely
meal
when
we
returned
to
our
room
we
were
delighted
to
find
that
the
towels
had
been
replenished
and
the
bed
turned
down
we
enjoyed
the
view
from
our
room
before
turning
in
and
having
a
very
restful
nightgs
sleep
in
an
incredibly
comfortable
bed
kudos
to
the
chicago
sheraton
for
getting
everything
just
right

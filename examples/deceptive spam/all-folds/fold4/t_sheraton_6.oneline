my
husband
and
i
stayed
at
the
sheraton
chicago
hotel
towers
in
february
everything
about
the
hotel
and
experience
was
superb
the
location
was
wonderful
as
well
our
room
overlooked
the
river
and
we
had
a
great
view
of
the
lake
towards
navy
pier
the
best
part
of
the
stay
was
the
sweet
sleeper
bed
it
was
so
comfortable
the
staff
was
friendly
and
helpful
as
well
nothing
bad
to
say
about
this
sheraton

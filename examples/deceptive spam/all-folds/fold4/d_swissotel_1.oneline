i
absolutely
loved
staying
at
the
swissotel
chicago
the
entire
hotel
has
such
an
elegant
and
luxurious
feel
to
it
the
room
was
absolutely
stunning
first
of
all
it
was
so
spotless
and
clean
the
design
of
it
was
beautiful
there
was
gorgeous
artwork
on
the
walls
even
the
design
was
very
modern
and
above
average
for
hotel
decor
there
was
a
separate
bath
and
separate
shower
which
i
loved
there
was
a
huge
lcd
flat
screen
tv
and
high
speed
wireless
internet
available
there
was
even
an
ipod
docking
station
which
was
great
for
listening
to
music
and
so
convenient
since
i
brought
my
ipod
with
me
the
view
from
the
window
of
chicago
was
beautiful
too
the
service
was
very
quick
and
everyone
was
very
friendly
i
didngt
have
any
problems
at
all
but
if
i
did
igm
sure
the
customer
service
at
the
hotel
would
have
had
it
fixed
very
quick
i
could
tell
their
top
priority
was
the
guests
happiness
and
satisfaction
there
were
even
two
restaurants
in
the
hotel
and
a
lounge
i
cangt
wait
to
go
back
to
this
hotel
it
felt
like
i
was
on
a
luxurious
vacation

beautiful
views
and
awesome
service
my
husband
and
i
stayed
at
the
swissotel
in
chicago
while
meeting
up
with
some
old
friends
from
college
we
have
been
to
chicago
a
few
times
but
never
stayed
at
this
hotel
before
first
off
the
architecture
and
feel
of
the
hotel
is
just
amazing
so
beautiful
the
views
from
our
corner
suite
was
breathtaking
and
the
accomodations
were
flawless
the
fact
that
we
could
have
an
apartment
like
setting
rather
than
a
cold
hotel
room
made
all
the
difference
from
the
big
tub
in
the
bath
to
the
entertainment
system
and
work
area
everything
is
in
place
to
make
your
stay
like
being
at
home
but
with
an
awesome
view
of
the
chicago
skyline
we
took
advantage
of
the
executive
club
for
desserts
and
breakfast
and
had
dinner
one
night
at
the
palm
restaurant
delicious
food
we
will
definitely
stay
at
the
swissotel
the
next
time
we
visit
chicago

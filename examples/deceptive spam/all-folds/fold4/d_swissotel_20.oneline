i
stayed
at
this
hotel
for
a
weekend
and
i
thought
it
was
really
nice
the
bed
was
extremely
comfortable
and
the
room
was
very
clean
the
room
also
had
a
beautiful
view
it
had
everything
you
could
possibly
need
i
almost
didngt
want
to
leave
the
room
it
was
definitly
worth
the
price
i
would
go
back
the
clientel
was
also
very
helpful

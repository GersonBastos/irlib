we
really
enjoyed
our
brief
stay
at
the
millennium
knickerbocker
from
the
front
desk
personnel
and
bellmen
to
the
housekeeping
staff
and
bartender
everyone
we
met
was
helpful
and
welcoming
our
floor
room
was
clean
and
beautiful
and
the
view
looking
north
to
the
drake
hotel
and
apartments
across
the
street
was
nice
the
in
room
coffee
service
was
appreciated
too
there
isngt
a
lot
of
room
in
the
bathroom
for
your
toiletries
but
igd
still
take
a
room
in
a
beautiful
older
hotel
with
character
over
a
spacious
but
cookie
cutter
room
any
day

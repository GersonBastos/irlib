we
stayed
at
the
millennium
knickerbocker
last
week
and
it
was
really
wonderful
first
off
the
staff
is
excellent
all
of
our
needs
were
addressed
quickly
and
with
a
smile
the
hotel
really
was
the
perfect
launching
pad
for
us
to
take
in
everything
that
chicago
has
to
offer
all
of
the
shopping
of
michigan
avenue
was
just
steps
from
our
room
we
decided
to
go
for
the
shedd
aquarium
package
we
started
the
day
with
a
really
wonderful
breakfast
at
the
hotel
and
then
thoroughly
enjoyed
our
all
access
pass
to
the
aquarium
very
cool
after
our
long
days
of
sightseeing
and
a
quick
stop
at
the
wonderful
martini
bar
it
was
so
nice
to
come
back
to
the
room
which
was
elegant
but
a
very
comfortable
sanctuary
from
the
busy
city
to
top
it
all
off
they
have
the
most
incredible
shower
that
igve
ever
used
and
even
better
itgs
all
green
what
more
can
i
say
the
millennium
knickerbocker
was
a
huge
part
of
what
made
our
vacation
so
wonderful
and
memorable
i
highly
recommend
it

my
wife
and
i
had
to
stay
downtown
for
event
that
we
were
attending
at
the
drake
hotel
i
have
stayed
at
the
drake
before
and
while
it
is
nice
it
is
bit
stuffy
and
a
little
outdated
for
the
price
we
opted
to
walk
across
the
street
and
stay
at
the
millenium
instead
i
know
this
property
has
under
gone
many
renovations
in
past
year
and
i
have
to
say
they
have
done
a
great
job
this
place
used
to
be
the
hotel
you
would
crash
in
when
you
came
to
chicago
on
a
college
roadtrip
i
did
but
that
is
not
the
case
any
more
this
property
is
directly
across
from
the
drake
hotel
and
for
the
price
you
get
their
great
location
with
a
newer
albeit
smaller
room
and
every
ammenity
you
would
expect
from
a
hotel
the
rooms
are
tastefully
decorated
asian
influence
w
flat
screen
tv
and
the
bed
is
very
comfortable
the
bath
is
small
no
tub
but
very
clean
and
the
shower
is
great
you
are
not
going
to
be
spending
a
bunch
of
time
in
your
room
when
visting
chicago
so
the
roomgs
size
is
not
a
big
deal
it
works
well
with
a
couple
but
a
family
of
four
may
be
a
bit
cramped
the
service
was
attentive
and
friendly
and
the
location
cangt
be
beat
i
would
definitely
stay
here
again
but
the
next
time
i
would
leave
the
car
at
home
parking
is
a
bit
steep

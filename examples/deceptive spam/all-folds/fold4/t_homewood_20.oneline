the
location
of
this
hotel
was
excellent
as
it
is
just
beside
the
subway
and
the
bus
stop
for
the
free
trolley
bus
to
navy
pier
is
just
beside
the
hotel
the
room
was
very
spacious
kind
of
too
big
for
a
solo
traveler
the
view
from
the
room
was
excellent
and
it
was
a
great
view
to
sleep
at
night
the
bathroom
was
spacious
too
and
the
room
has
a
big
wardrobe
the
kitchen
has
microwave
oven
and
cooking
utensils
some
of
the
cooking
utensils
were
a
bit
dirty
probably
because
they
had
not
been
used
for
sometime
however
the
microwave
oven
was
very
useful
as
i
can
heat
up
food
to
eat
at
night
you
can
easily
walk
to
the
magnificent
mile
by
cutting
across
the
shopping
mall
across
the
road
do
check
out
pizzeria
uno
which
is
near
the
hotel
that
serves
the
delicious
deep
dish
pizza
for
cheaper
food
do
check
out
the
foodcourt
at
the
shopping
mall
the
hotel
also
serves
breakfast
and
dinner
from
mon
to
thur
i
did
not
find
the
food
that
fantastic
but
it
was
pretty
decent
i
will
strongly
recommend
this
hotel
to
everyone
going
to
chicago

the
homewood
suites
by
hilton
in
downtown
chicago
has
to
be
one
of
the
most
comfortable
and
affordable
hotels
in
the
windy
city
after
asking
the
doorman
i
discovered
all
guest
suites
in
the
entire
establishment
feature
a
two
room
layout
with
a
fully
equipped
kitchen
the
full
sized
refrigerator
caused
me
to
do
a
double
take
as
did
the
stove
and
lcd
televisions
this
is
definitely
the
place
to
have
a
home
away
from
home
while
in
chicago
itgs
mind
blowing
that
a
hotel
this
extravagant
can
have
rates
as
low
as
a
night
which
is
what
i
payed
when
i
stayed
there
in
september
the
atmosphere
was
warm
and
cozy
and
the
staff
were
all
very
friendly
and
professional

when
my
sister
got
married
last
summer
our
stay
at
the
sheraton
hotel
was
delightful
billy
and
the
kids
and
i
were
exhausted
after
the
long
flight
from
san
francisco
so
itgs
a
good
thing
that
we
found
the
perfect
place
to
relax
the
kids
adored
the
indoor
pool
billy
couldngt
stop
talking
about
the
beautiful
jogging
path
and
i
even
pampered
myself
by
taking
advantage
of
the
massage
therapy
before
the
big
day
the
reception
dinner
at
shulags
steakhouse
was
fun
and
delicious
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
hotel
to
any
one
who
is
in
chicago
for
an
extended
visit

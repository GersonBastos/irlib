swissotel
was
the
cleanest
hotel
i
have
ever
stayed
in
the
room
and
bathroom
were
quite
large
for
downtown
chicago
the
pool
and
hot
tub
were
also
very
nice
i
would
definately
recommend
this
hotel
we
didngt
hear
any
noise
in
our
room
from
other
guests
or
from
the
city
it
is
in
a
great
location
walking
distance
to
millenium
park
the
loop
and
michigan
ave

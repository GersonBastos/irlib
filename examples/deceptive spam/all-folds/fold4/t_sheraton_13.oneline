we
recently
celebrated
our
anniversary
in
chicago
and
stayed
at
the
sheraton
chicago
hotel
and
towers
having
looked
at
a
gizillion
places
i
chose
this
one
because
of
its
location
to
navy
pier
we
were
going
on
a
dinner
cruise
the
odyssey
at
navy
pier
the
hotel
is
a
short
walk
unless
you
are
wearing
heelsg
to
navy
pier
we
found
out
on
the
way
home
only
a
cab
rideg
worth
to
your
blisters
its
also
only
a
short
walk
to
michigan
ave
shopping
for
comfortable
shoes
perhaps
i
chose
this
hotel
because
of
location
but
the
views
are
also
terrific
this
time
we
had
a
lake
view
of
navy
pier
but
our
previous
trip
we
had
a
river
and
lake
view
both
very
nice
the
hotel
is
very
nice
several
restaurants
although
we
havengt
tried
them
the
burger
place
downstairs
sure
smelled
good
thoughg
we
ended
up
at
bubba
gumps
at
navy
pier
good
the
rooms
were
very
spacious
and
clean
i
am
kind
of
a
germaphobe
so
clean
is
important
for
my
sanityg
the
bottom
level
has
doors
that
leads
right
out
to
the
riverwalk
and
a
cool
water
fountain
g
i
obviously
highly
recommend
this
hotelg
i
chicago

what
a
gorgeous
hotel
from
the
moment
we
stepped
inside
the
warm
colors
of
the
lobby
made
us
feel
welcome
at
the
sheraton
and
in
chicago
the
heavenly
beds
made
the
view
from
our
room
that
much
better
and
to
top
it
off
with
great
restaurants
you
couldngt
ask
a
hotel
for
more
starbucks
coffee
in
the
rooms
were
just
an
extra
touch
that
guarantees
wegll
be
back
every
time
we
visit
chicago

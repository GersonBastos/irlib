i
wouldngt
know
how
to
begin
to
write
something
negative
about
the
millenium
knickerbocker
hotel
in
chicago
everything
about
this
hotel
is
fantastic
from
the
outside
of
the
building
to
the
hotel
lobby
all
the
way
to
the
rooms
with
very
clean
and
plush
rooms
this
is
the
place
to
stay
when
you
are
not
at
the
hotel
eating
at
the
elegant
dining
area
or
having
a
great
breakfast
first
thing
in
the
morning
there
is
plenty
to
do
around
the
town
take
a
shopping
spree
down
michigan
ave
or
head
to
one
of
the
museums
or
the
pier
to
look
around
whatever
you
decide
to
do
you
cangt
go
wrong
this
place
is
wonderful

my
wife
and
igs
stay
at
the
sheraton
chicago
hotel
and
towers
proved
to
be
the
perfect
complement
to
our
time
spent
visiting
and
exploring
the
windy
city
upon
our
arrival
we
were
immediately
welcomed
by
the
beautiful
design
of
the
first
floor
lobby
and
the
friendly
demeanor
of
the
desk
and
bell
service
staff
in
seemingly
no
time
at
all
we
were
in
our
clean
and
well
furnished
room
with
a
beautiful
and
peaceful
view
of
lake
michigan
in
terms
of
accommodations
i
have
never
personally
stayed
at
a
hotel
that
i
could
complement
more
on
our
very
first
night
my
wife
took
advantage
of
a
message
therapy
session
while
i
swam
a
few
laps
in
the
heated
indoor
swimming
pool
we
followed
our
time
apart
with
a
very
relaxing
time
at
the
chi
bar
which
had
a
very
enlivening
and
laid
back
atmosphere
retiring
to
our
rooms
i
couldngt
help
but
remark
to
my
wife
about
the
quality
of
our
room
and
the
bed
in
particular
i
had
a
very
comfortable
nightgs
sleep
and
woke
up
just
on
time
thanks
to
a
spot
on
wake
up
call
from
the
desk
staff
after
a
quick
bite
to
eat
the
lb
bistro
we
headed
out
to
sight
see
overall
i
cangt
recommend
the
sheraton
chicago
hotel
and
towers
enough
as
far
as
this
customer
is
concerned
it
is
the
only
place
to
stay
if
you
are
in
the
chicago
area
and
are
looking
for
accommodations
with
the
best
customer
service
atmosphere
and
amenities
i
couldngt
recommend
it
more

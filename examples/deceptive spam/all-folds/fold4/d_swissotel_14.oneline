staying
at
the
swissotel
in
downtown
chicago
is
not
so
much
the
typical
stay
so
much
as
it
is
an
experience
not
only
is
the
hotel
located
in
a
great
area
to
get
to
all
local
attractions
but
while
you
are
at
the
hotel
you
will
have
many
amazing
accommodations
at
your
disposal
there
are
two
gourmet
on
site
restaurants
and
a
lounge
to
relax
and
get
great
food
the
rooms
are
over
sized
and
the
beds
are
among
the
most
comfortable
you
will
ever
find
finally
the
service
is
award
winning
so
anything
that
you
do
not
already
have
at
the
swissotel
will
be
at
your
fingertips
with
their
assistance
overall
i
would
highly
recommend
this
hotel
to
anyone
who
is
looking
for
more
than
the
typical
hotel

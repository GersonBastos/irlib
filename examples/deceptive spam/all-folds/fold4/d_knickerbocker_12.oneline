this
hotel
was
incredible
havengt
had
a
better
stay
in
a
hotel
in
my
life
i
will
definitely
come
here
again
next
time
i
am
in
chicago
the
rooms
were
so
elegant
with
their
modern
color
schemes
the
staff
members
were
friendly
and
willing
to
lend
a
hand
the
beds
were
surprisingly
comfortable
with
interesting
covers
the
tvs
were
hd
which
was
a
step
up
from
most
hotels
i
have
stayed
at
before
there
was
a
cool
martini
bar
that
i
spent
an
hour
at
one
night
which
was
enjoyable
especially
because
of
the
live
jazz
band

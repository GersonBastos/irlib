i
recently
stayed
at
this
hotel
with
my
family
we
had
a
terrific
experience
i
landed
the
hotel
through
priceline
for
per
night
and
paid
an
additional
per
night
for
a
suite
on
the
floor
my
two
young
boys
loved
it
as
the
view
was
unbelieveable
and
the
pool
on
the
floor
was
easily
accessible
i
found
all
the
employees
that
we
interfaced
with
to
be
very
friendly
and
accommodating
i
would
love
to
stay
here
again

i
stayed
at
the
millennium
knickerbocker
hotel
for
a
fun
weekend
in
chicago
the
standard
room
had
a
nice
king
size
bed
that
was
nice
and
comfortable
i
love
a
hotel
with
all
white
sheets
because
then
i
know
itgs
clean
i
really
liked
the
simple
and
modern
decor
especially
the
huge
upholstered
headboard
nice
fixtures
in
the
bathroom
and
granite
counter
the
bathroom
was
so
much
nicer
than
my
own
bathroom
at
home
the
staff
was
friendly
cangt
really
judge
the
service
because
i
didngt
have
any
problems
or
complaints
so
i
didngt
have
a
reason
to
interact
with
the
staff
much
overall
it
was
a
very
nice
hotel
in
a
great
location
will
definitely
stay
here
again
on
my
next
visit

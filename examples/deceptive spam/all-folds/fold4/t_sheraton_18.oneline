i
have
been
times
in
chicago
and
i
have
stayed
in
different
hotelsg
this
has
been
for
much
the
very
best
option
the
lobby
the
warm
of
the
receptionist
the
room
the
hotel
is
very
good
it
is
walking
distance
to
the
magnificent
mile
and
theregs
no
chance
for
you
to
get
lost
from
this
hotel
if
you
like
to
travel
with
style

could
be
a
very
good
option

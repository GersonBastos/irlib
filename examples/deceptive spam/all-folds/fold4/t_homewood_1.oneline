i
travelled
to
illinois
from
the
uk
on
business
and
booked
friday
and
saturday
night
at
the
homewood
suites
so
that
i
could
have
a
weekend
in
the
city
the
location
was
perfect
walking
distance
to
michigan
ave
for
all
the
shopping
and
touristy
stuff
and
literally
yards
to
the
l
red
line
for
getting
out
to
the
surrounding
areas
the
room
was
greatg
not
exactly
gwow'
decor
but
clean
and
really
well
stocked
i
was
expecting
a
gsuite'
to
be
a
larger
than
average
hotel
room
with
seperate
sitting
area
it
was
actually
a
room
mini
apartment
with
an
open
lounge
kitchen
bedroom
and
bathroom
two
flatscreen
tvs
and
a
huge
bed
breakfast
buffet
eggs
and
bacon
were
great
for
the
hangover
and
the
kitchen
meant
that
i
could
cook
up
some
lunch
rather
than
eat
out
if
needed

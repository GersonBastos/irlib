my
stay
at
the
hilton
was
like
living
in
luxury
for
a
few
days
i
never
wanted
to
go
back
home
much
less
leave
the
hotel
during
my
stay
i
could
work
out
in
their
facility
and
swim
at
no
added
charge
in
fact
they
didngt
charge
for
wifi
morning
breakfast
or
their
grocery
shopping
service
the
lobby
always
had
complimentary
coffee
tea
soda
and
meals
i
felt
like
a
queen
this
hotel
deserves
highest
marks
for
service

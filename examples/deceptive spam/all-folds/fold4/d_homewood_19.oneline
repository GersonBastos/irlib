i
work
for
a
software
marketing
firm
and
that
job
requires
me
to
travel
at
least
days
per
year
i
spend
a
large
amount
of
time
in
hotels
i
normally
dongt
write
reviews
for
hotels
but
the
homewood
suites
by
hilton
were
above
and
beyond
letgs
start
where
it
mattersg
the
rooms
they
are
top
notch
theregs
nothing
better
than
walking
in
to
a
clean
beautiful
rooms
after
a
long
day
of
travel
the
beds
are
among
the
best
igve
ever
slept
in
in
hotels
the
rest
of
the
room
is
just
as
nice
and
makes
me
feel
at
home
the
priceg
low
i
looked
for
similar
rooms
in
the
area
at
other
hotels
and
everything
else
was
at
least
more
expensive
but
you
dongt
get
what
you
pay
for
here
you
get
much
more
than
that
the
locationg
couldngt
be
better
you
want
to
go
to
a
world
class
restaurant
thatgs
within
walking
distance
you
want
a
great
shopping
experience
again
walking
distance
anything
else
you
want
chances
are
itgs
within
walking
distance
overall
one
of
the
best
hotels
igve
ever
stayed
in

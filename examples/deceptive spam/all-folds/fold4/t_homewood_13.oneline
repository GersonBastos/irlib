everything
that
i
read
from
other
reviews
was
pretty
much
on
the
money
they
have
excellent
customer
service
the
employees
there
really
cared
about
their
guests
there
was
always
coffee
tea
hot
chocolate
in
the
lobby
good
hot
breakfast
and
dinner
with
wine
and
beer
the
doormen
were
nice
and
willing
to
help
out
for
directions
the
room
did
the
job
there
was
a
kitchen
flat
screen
tvgs
and
a
pullout
couch
included
it
was
close
to
the
el
but
for
us
we
found
the
buses
to
be
more
useful
i
would
recommend
getting
a
pass
we
got
a
day
pass
and
it
was
well
worth
it
for
which
we
got
at
jewel
osco
not
too
far
from
the
hotel
for
the
most
part
the
majority
of
the
people
that
were
there
were
older
people
on
a
business
trip
and
families
but
us
three
girls
didngt
mind
so
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
place
it
was
one
of
the
cheapest
places
were
found
out
of
all
the
other
hotels

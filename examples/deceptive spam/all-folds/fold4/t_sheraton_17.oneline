we
stayed
at
this
hotel
for
nights
in
august
we
waited
a
while
to
check
in
even
though
there
were
quite
a
few
desks
open
this
was
a
little
annoying
as
the
receptionists
seemed
to
work
in
twogs
our
room
had
a
great
view
of
navy
pier
and
was
a
good
size
the
bed
was
very
comfortable
and
the
room
was
spotlessly
clean
the
location
of
the
hotel
is
the
best
we
walked
to
navy
pier
and
michigan
ave
the
breakfast
buffet
was
great
although
a
little
pricey
and
the
bar
very
relaxing
for
a
nightcap
or
two
would
certainly
recommend
this
hotel
and
would
stay
here
again

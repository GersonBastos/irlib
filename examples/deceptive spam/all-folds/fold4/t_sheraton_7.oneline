this
was
a
great
place
to
be
great
views
of
river
and
lake
walk
to
everything
a
clean
and
comfortable
room
and
very
accommodating
staff
we
arrived
early
and
were
checked
in
by
am
and
checked
out
late
effectively
adding
two
days
to
our
vacation
it
is
a
large
hotel
but
the
staff
works
hard
and
takes
good
care
of
the
customers

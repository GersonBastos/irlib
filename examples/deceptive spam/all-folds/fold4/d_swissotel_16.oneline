i
must
say
this
hotel
is
absolutely
beautiful
my
wife
and
i
were
blown
away
by
the
penthouse
fitness
center
and
pool
all
the
way
up
on
the
floor
very
well
designed
rooms
with
great
linens
and
pillows
the
bathrooms
were
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
boring
hotel
bathrooms
we
usually
see
overall
an
excellent
experience
here
great
views
and
close
to
everything
you
could
want
to
do
in
chicago

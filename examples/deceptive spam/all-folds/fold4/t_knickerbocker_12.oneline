complain
about
the
small
rooms
for
a
major
city
we
found
our
room
quite
comfortable
with
a
king
bed
and
really
nice
furnishings
one
feature
we
liked
is
the
ability
to
open
the
window
the
knikerbocker
is
a
small
boutique
hotel
right
off
michigan
avenue
in
the
best
area
of
chicago
the
staff
was
friendly
and
helpful
for
the
we
paid
on
hotwire
we
could
not
have
found
a
better
room
in
downtown
chicago

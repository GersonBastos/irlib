my
daughter
and
i
were
in
chicago
for
one
night
after
having
attended
a
three
day
conference
elsewhere
in
illinois
we
were
only
in
chicago
on
our
way
home
we
didngt
know
where
to
stay
in
chicago
but
booked
one
night
at
the
sheraton
chicago
hotel
and
towers
based
on
their
ad
in
the
chicago
visitors
guide
wegre
glad
we
did
we
enjoyed
our
stay
very
much
our
room
was
very
comfortable
and
well
appointed
and
had
a
wonderful
view
of
the
city
thatgs
what
we
wanted
a
great
view
and
we
got
it
also
the
hotel
is
within
walking
distance
of
many
attractions
and
is
accessible
from
the
bus
stop
we
took
the
train
and
bus
from
the
airport
into
the
city
and
it
wasngt
bad
saved
us
a
lot
of
money
the
elevators
to
our
room
were
fast
and
quick
and
there
was
one
always
available
we
found
the
front
desk
staff
to
be
friendly
and
accommodating
the
only
downside
for
us
is
that
we
had
only
booked
one
night
in
chicago
we
wish
we
could
have
stayed
there
at
the
sheraton
for
at
least
another
night
we
would
definitely
stay
there
again

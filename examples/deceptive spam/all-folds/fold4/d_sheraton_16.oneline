the
sheraton
chicago
hotel
and
towers
is
my
favorite
place
to
stay
in
chicago
i
travel
to
chicago
very
often
to
visit
my
son
who
is
training
for
the
u
s
navy
they
make
every
stay
feel
like
a
luxorius
vacation
the
indoor
pool
and
sauna
are
amazing
and
i
never
have
to
miss
a
workout
because
the
gym
is
fully
equipped
if
you
dine
at
the
lb
bistro
you
must
try
the
eggs
benedict
g
the
staff
are
friendly
and
the
prices
are
very
reasonable
for
a
hotel
of
this
stature

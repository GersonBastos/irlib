i
stayed
at
the
swissotel
for
a
business
trip
the
first
week
of
aug
i
arrived
late
the
first
night
and
got
shoved
into
a
hospitality
room
the
first
night
however
this
was
more
than
made
up
when
after
a
strong
talk
they
assigned
me
a
corner
room
on
the
floor
excellent
view
of
the
city
river
and
lake
michigan
in
fact
i
would
say
the
corner
room
of
the
swissotel
has
a
better
view
than
any
other
hotel
in
the
vicinity
the
room
was
huge
and
everything
was
clean
and
the
bathroom
was
nice
the
hotel
is
very
convieniently
located
to
the
magnificient
mile
and
millenium
park
would
very
much
recommend
this
hotel
and
would
suggest
trying
every
method
possible
to
get
a
corner
room
in
a
higher
floor

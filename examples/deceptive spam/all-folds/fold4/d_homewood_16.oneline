i
would
first
like
to
say
how
inviting
the
rooms
themselves
are
for
my
wife
and
i
we
enjoy
the
warmer
colors
cleanliness
along
with
excellent
staff
made
me
feel
away
from
home
yet
relaxed
being
right
downtown
was
perfect
for
location
the
suites
are
very
quiet
as
well
i
surprised
my
wife
with
the
shopping
package
what
a
hit
thanks

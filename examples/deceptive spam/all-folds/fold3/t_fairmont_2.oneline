i
stayed
at
the
fairmont
chicago
for
one
night
igm
a
frequent
business
traveler
and
am
very
familiar
with
travel
rituals
i
checked
in
late
almost
due
to
flight
cancellations
from
my
home
airport
atlanta
i
took
the
shuttle
to
the
airport
best
option
in
lieu
of
the
over
priced
taxis
and
it
was
my
first
time
staying
at
the
hotel
upon
arrival
i
immediately
noticed
the
entrance
which
appeared
very
welcoming
and
warm
to
me
i
checked
in
with
no
problems
and
the
desk
person
even
asked
if
igd
prefer
a
king
or
double
reconfirming
my
reservation
preference
i
always
take
the
king
when
i
can
and
the
bed
was
fantastic
it
was
suited
with
great
linen
and
these
incredible
down
feather
pillows
named
encompass
made
by
the
pillow
factory
i
checked
the
tags
since
i
plan
to
buy
some
i
ate
dinner
at
the
hotel
restaurant
aria
which
they
mention
they
like
to
be
considered
separate
from
the
hotel
and
yes
it
does
stand
out
all
on
itgs
own
the
food
is
asian
fusion
and
truly
wonderful
as
a
gourmand
and
life
long
foodie
i
appreciate
great
food
when
i
taste
it
the
hotel
service
was
good
as
well
only
drawback
was
the
breakfast
buffet
at
the
restaurant
seems
they
need
to
stick
with
their
dinner
theme
solely
they
missed
the
mark
on
relatively
simply
things
like
scrambled
eggs
on
the
buffet
which
tasted
a
bit
gmetallic'
but
they
made
up
for
it
by
getting
a
special
order
made
immediately
after
i
passed
on
the
buffet
i
would
highly
recommend
this
hotel
it
has
atmosphere
and
a
great
view
if
you
can
get
a
room
with
one
fabulous
dinner
just
pass
on
the
breakfast
buffet

we
arrived
at
the
omni
on
september
for
a
day
stay
i
took
ill
when
i
left
the
plane
after
travelling
from
manchester
so
i
saw
more
of
the
room
than
i
anticipated
i
couldngt
go
out
for
days
the
room
was
spacious
and
clean
the
bed
was
extremely
comfortable
the
bathroom
was
large
and
very
clean
what
more
could
you
ask
we
had
coffee
and
juice
left
outside
our
door
every
morning
at
the
time
we
requested
i
managed
to
go
to
the
floor
to
see
the
sun
terrace
outside
the
gym
having
a
sun
terrace
in
a
city
hotel
is
a
great
idea
but
the
terrace
was
a
bit
grim
a
few
sunbeds
on
a
concrete
floor
there
was
also
noise
from
an
air
conditioning
unit
it
could
do
with
a
bit
of
cheering
up
what
i
saw
of
chicago
was
very
pleasing
it
has
something
for
everyone
would
i
go
back
to
the
omni
yes
i
would

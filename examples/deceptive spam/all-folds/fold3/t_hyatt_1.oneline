i
got
a
sunday
night
stay
for
only
off
of
priceline
com
so
it
would
be
hard
to
complain
but
this
was
truly
a
great
hotel
even
if
i
paid
double
the
first
impression
you
get
when
you
walk
through
the
sliding
doors
of
the
hyatt
regency
chicago
is
wow
the
lobby
is
beautiful
with
a
upscale
mall
type
of
look
to
it
with
an
open
area
that
has
a
restaurant
plenty
of
couches
seats
etc
to
people
watch
and
a
lake
with
water
fountains
you
take
the
escalator
to
the
concierge
directory
check
in
area
the
hotel
let
me
check
in
at
i
had
a
check
in
time
i
suggest
you
call
ahead
like
i
did
so
they
know
you
are
coming
early
the
women
at
the
desk
was
friendly
and
when
i
requested
a
higher
level
floor
she
was
more
than
happy
to
look
it
up
and
even
told
me
i
have
a
room
on
the
floor
with
a
veiw
of
the
river
or
you
can
go
higher
with
no
view
i
thought
it
was
pretty
nice
to
give
me
that
information
so
that
i
wouldnt
get
stuck
with
a
room
with
a
view
of
a
wall
the
rooms
are
big
i
had
a
doubles
room
the
beds
were
beautiful
with
great
pillows
blankets
headboards
etc
an
ipod
alarm
clock
was
a
nice
century
touch
to
the
room
great
to
plug
in
your
ipod
listen
to
some
music
and
get
ready
for
a
night
out
or
when
relaxing
after
a
long
day
of
touring
chicago
the
view
was
very
nice
and
the
bathroom
was
spotless
and
had
great
toiletries
another
great
feature
is
the
concierge
areags
computers
that
gives
you
access
to
printing
your
boarding
pass
before
you
get
to
the
airport
you
simply
look
at
the
screen
click
on
your
airline
icon
and
following
the
instructions
i
had
my
boarding
passes
in
about
a
minute
came
in
handy
when
i
got
to
ohare
and
was
able
to
skip
a
long
line
of
frustrated
passengers
i
was
only
in
the
hotel
for
day
but
it
was
by
far
one
of
the
better
hotel
experiences
i
have
had
and
i
travel
alot
it
is
a
business
hotel
but
definitely
a
great
choice
for
families
and
couples
definitely
would
stay
here
again
when
im
passing
through
chicago

the
location
of
this
hotel
was
superb
our
room
was
spacious
and
the
view
was
spectacular
the
staff
at
the
hotel
treated
my
family
with
the
upmost
respect
one
of
the
front
desk
staff
even
helped
my
five
year
old
tie
his
shoes
while
we
were
waiting
for
the
porter
we
will
stay
here
again
and
advise
our
friends
to
do
the
same

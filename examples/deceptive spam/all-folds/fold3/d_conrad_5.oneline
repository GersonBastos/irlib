we
were
amazed
by
this
hotel
the
first
great
part
is
the
location
its
so
close
to
some
of
the
great
shopping
the
city
has
to
offer
the
view
from
the
terrace
suite
at
night
was
breathtaking
looking
over
chicago
they
even
had
a
florist
as
i
bought
my
wife
a
rose
the
menus
the
lobby
everything
was
fantastic
the
room
was
clean
when
we
arrived
as
it
was
every
time
we
came
back
to
it
each
day
i
didngt
use
the
fitness
center
but
it
looked
very
nice
i
did
however
visit
the
bar
and
when
i
return
to
chicago
i
will
again

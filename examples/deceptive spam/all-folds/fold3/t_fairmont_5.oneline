we
recently
completed
our
second
stay
at
the
fairmont
chicago
the
check
in
process
was
quick
and
painless
but
the
front
desk
staff
was
almost
disinterested
in
the
whole
procedure
that
is
fine
when
i
am
traveling
on
business
but
on
leisure
trips
i
would
appreciate
a
warmer
greeting
the
hotel
was
hosting
a
convention
at
the
same
time
as
our
stay
but
other
than
seeing
some
signage
attendees
in
the
lobby
we
wouldngt
have
noticed
this
is
probably
due
to
the
separation
of
the
conference
areas
from
the
guest
rooms
and
the
speedy
elevators
we
stayed
in
a
parkview
suite
so
we
had
a
large
room
with
a
great
view
of
millenium
park
the
anteroom
was
well
appointed
with
a
sofa
coffee
table
desk
mini
bar
with
sink
and
coffee
maker
and
dining
area
the
bedroom
appeared
to
be
the
same
as
a
standard
fairmont
room
but
maybe
slightly
larger
the
bathroom
also
appeared
to
be
similar
to
a
standard
fairmont
room
and
once
again
possibly
slightly
larger
the
upscale
modern
decor
is
pleasing
but
not
overtly
luxurious
and
several
small
touches
such
as
a
shoe
shine
station
with
extra
collar
tabs
are
peppered
throughout
we
booked
a
few
evening
activities
through
the
concierge
and
everything
was
perfectly
handled
the
hotel
restaurant
aria
couldngt
find
our
reservation
but
they
oddly
new
my
name
and
remembered
that
the
hotel
had
called
to
make
a
reservation
for
us
they
had
no
problem
seating
us
and
the
dinner
both
food
and
service
was
lovely
minor
complaintsg
the
pillows
could
be
better
igm
not
sure
if
they
remembered
our
preference
for
non
down
bedding
from
our
last
visit
but
seriously
these
things
barely
felt
like
pillows
igll
suffer
through
some
congestion
if
i
can
get
better
neck
support
also
the
valet
parking
attendants
seem
overly
eager
to
take
your
car
and
charge
you
and
as
i
mentioned
above
the
front
desk
experience
could
be
improved
best
featureg
after
our
first
stay
i
gave
a
brief
review
in
the
comments
section
of
the
fairmont
presidentgs
club
membership
is
free
website
i
received
a
phone
call
from
the
director
of
rooms
the
same
day
asking
to
discuss
our
experience
after
this
stay
i
left
a
comment
essentially
thanking
the
hotel
staff
for
a
great
stay
but
still
received
a
warm
friendly
phone
call
from
the
director
of
rooms
asking
if
he
could
do
anything
to
improve
our
next
stay
kudos
to
the
fairmont
for
taking
its
customers
seriously
and
for
that
theygve
won
my
loyalty

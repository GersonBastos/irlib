i
recently
stayed
at
the
hyatt
regency
in
chicago
for
business
but
extended
my
stay
through
the
weekend
because
i
loved
it
the
accommodations
exceeded
my
expectations
my
bed
was
very
comfortable
the
room
was
big
enough
and
the
shower
was
so
relaxing
i
had
a
great
meal
in
the
chop
shop
and
the
coffee
was
delicious
at
jgs
express
the
fitness
center
was
clean
and
inspiring
i
will
recommend
this
hotel
to
others
while
in
the
area

my
husband
and
i
recently
traveled
to
chicago
on
a
mini
vacation
we
stayed
at
the
omni
chicago
hotel
in
the
downtown
area
this
hotel
is
simply
beautiful
from
the
time
we
walked
through
the
front
doors
until
the
day
we
left
we
were
treated
as
if
we
were
royalty
i
have
never
been
treated
so
well
we
were
greeted
by
staff
that
sincerely
seemed
to
love
their
jobs
we
stayed
in
a
superior
corner
suite
the
view
of
the
city
was
the
most
amazing
thing
i
had
ever
seen
the
rooms
were
very
spacious
and
clean
the
king
size
bed
was
extremely
comfortable
the
room
didngt
seem
like
we
were
in
a
hotel
it
had
the
feeling
of
home
there
was
a
separate
living
room
area
which
was
wonderful
my
husband
and
i
just
sat
there
one
night
and
stared
out
the
window
at
the
skyline
it
was
mesmerizing
we
ordered
room
service
because
we
had
a
long
day
of
shopping
which
the
hotel
is
very
convenient
to
a
lot
of
great
shopping
most
everything
is
in
walking
distance
the
food
was
to
die
forg
it
was
as
if
we
were
eating
at
a
star
fine
dining
restaurant
we
did
manage
to
go
down
and
have
a
few
drinks
in
the
lounge
the
lounge
had
a
classy
feel
to
it
very
relaxing
yet
sophisticated
we
even
received
a
massage
in
our
room
while
we
did
have
all
the
conveniences
of
home
such
as
internet
and
tv
we
did
not
even
think
about
using
them
being
that
we
just
wanted
to
get
away
from
our
everyday
lives
this
was
the
most
romantic
vacation
my
husband
and
i
have
ever
taken
i
cannot
express
how
happy
we
were
to
have
stayed
in
this
hotel
we
had
other
options
but
i
am
so
glad
we
decided
to
stay
here
the
rate
for
the
room
was
so
inexpensive
for
the
amount
of
luxury
we
were
able
to
experience
which
the
experience
itself
is
priceless
i
will
definitely
share
my
experience
with
anyone
and
everyone
and
recommend
this
hotel

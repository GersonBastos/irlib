i
stayed
at
the
fairmont
during
a
professional
conference
while
i
have
to
say
that
for
a
conference
some
of
the
meeting
rooms
were
too
small
in
terms
of
travelergs
comfort
the
hotel
is
exceptional
i
cangt
think
of
a
single
thing
about
my
room
that
wasngt
perfect
the
accommodations
were
luxurious
and
the
hotel
is
conveniently
situated
within
walking
distance
of
many
chicago
attractions

the
omni
chicago
hotel
i
am
a
business
woman
who
travels
a
great
deal
out
of
a
month
therefore
my
accommodations
must
meet
the
highest
standards
i
was
booked
for
a
stay
at
the
omni
chicago
hotel
located
in
what
is
referred
to
as
g
the
magnificent
mile
g
in
the
greater
chicago
area
g
magnificent
g
it
was
the
beautifully
red
bricked
sky
scraper
was
indeed
a
breath
taking
sight
and
upon
entrance
i
had
a
felling
of
warmth
from
the
very
hospitable
welcoming
staff
i
was
impressed
with
the
hotels
special
rates
offered
during
prime
business
hours
and
the
guest
rooms
ranged
everything
from
g
the
presidential
suite
to
the
governors
suite
g
i
accepted
a
more
humble
room
as
i
would
not
need
to
spend
very
much
time
there
during
the
day
i
did
stay
inside
most
nights
and
the
amenities
were
more
than
satisfactory
i
enjoyed
the
very
spacious
exercise
room
and
afterwards
i
would
take
a
quick
dip
in
the
pool
i
toured
the
hotel
as
my
niece
is
planning
her
wedding
and
just
so
happens
to
live
close
to
the
hotel
the
g
chagall
ballroom
g
was
elegant
enough
for
such
an
occasion
and
reeked
of
pure
luxury
i
was
given
very
adequate
maps
and
directions
to
and
from
as
my
business
was
conducted
throughout
the
city
that
was
a
life
saver
all
in
all
my
experience
was
more
than
favorable
and
i
would
definitely
stay
there
again
along
with
recommending
it
to
anyone

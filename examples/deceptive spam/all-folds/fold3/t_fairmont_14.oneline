i
recently
stayed
at
the
fairmont
chicago
and
found
it
to
be
a
fantastic
hotel
staff
was
always
courteous
and
helpful
from
the
front
desk
staff
at
check
in
to
wait
staff
in
aria
restaurant
to
the
maid
who
cleaned
my
room
the
rooms
were
recently
updated
with
large
flat
screen
tvgs
beautiful
linens
and
exceptional
toiletries
in
each
room
my
room
even
had
a
view
of
monroe
st
harbor
it
is
truly
a
first
rate
hotel
location
is
south
of
the
river
and
east
of
michigan
ave
as
we
normally
stay
north
of
the
river
it
seems
a
little
out
of
the
way
if
thatgs
possible
in
downtown
chicago
however
its
location
significantly
lowers
street
noise
the
hotel
has
excellent
access
to
millennium
park
the
aon
center
there
is
a
connecting
concourse
and
is
about
blocks
from
shopping
on
north
michigan
ave
i
ate
dinner
in
aria
and
it
was
fantastic
room
service
for
breakfast
was
quite
good
as
well
overall
igd
stay
again
in
a
minute
if
i
had
business
in
the
loop
or
leisure
plans
in
millennium
or
grant
parks

recently
i
traveled
to
chicago
for
a
business
conference
and
was
lucky
enough
to
stay
at
the
hyatt
regency
chicago
the
whole
experience
was
wonderful
the
room
was
spacious
and
beautiful
and
the
bed
was
so
comfortable
that
i
had
no
problem
falling
asleep
as
i
normally
do
at
other
hotels
the
staff
were
polite
and
courteous
and
after
a
delicious
breakfast
in
the
restaurant
i
went
to
my
conference
with
a
smile
on
my
face

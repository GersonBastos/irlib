i
recently
made
a
business
trip
to
chicago
in
which
i
stayed
at
the
downtown
fairmont
hotel
during
my
visit
i
had
an
aroma
harmony
massage
this
experience
greatly
relieved
my
stress
from
all
the
business
meetings
igd
had
that
day
candace
worked
wonders
for
my
neck
muscles
especially
this
was
the
only
amenity
that
i
sought
out
during
my
trip
my
time
was
very
limited
however
the
entire
staff
at
this
hotel
treated
me
as
if
i
were
a
valued
guest
igll
definately
stay
at
this
hotel
again
when
igm
in
the
area
and
i
highly
recommend
the
spa

my
visit
to
the
conrad
chicago
in
the
heart
of
downtown
was
a
luxurious
experience
bar
none
the
lobby
is
immaculate
and
is
filled
with
reams
of
class
and
style
the
rooms
are
beautifully
adorned
i
especially
like
the
flat
screen
tv
and
wired
internet
igm
never
happy
with
wireless
connections
so
it
is
nice
to
find
a
hotel
that
knows
that
its
guests
need
fast
reliable
internet
connectivity
and
itgs
included
at
no
additional
charge
the
view
from
the
room
was
magnificent
downtown
chicago
at
night
the
restaurant
is
spectacular
but
the
terrace
is
the
place
to
be
when
weather
permits
you
cannot
get
a
more
breathtaking
view
and
be
able
to
relax
in
the
gentle
breeze
of
evening
while
dining
on
the
finest
gourmet
foods
dongt
forget
to
visit
the
health
and
fitness
center
with
their
selection
of
aerobic
and
anaerobic
workout
equipment
the
staff
is
attentive
to
your
every
need
and
the
concierges
can
get
you
whatever
you
need
just
ask
this
is
the
place
to
stay
in
chicago
if
you
want
to
be
pampered
in
luxury

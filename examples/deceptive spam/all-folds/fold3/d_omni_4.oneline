we
really
enjoyed
our
stay
it
is
a
beautiful
hotel
and
the
entire
staff
is
helpful
and
polite
they
had
great
suggestions
on
where
to
eat
what
to
do
etc
we
were
within
walking
distance
of
many
great
chicago
locations
like
the
navy
pier
and
art
institute
the
rooms
were
clean
and
the
beds
comfortable
i
would
recommend
this
hotel
to
anyone
looking
for
a
great
home
away
from
home
in
chicago

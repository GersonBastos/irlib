my
husband
and
i
stayed
at
the
hyatt
regency
while
attending
a
family
wedding
in
chicago
from
the
moment
we
entered
the
beautiful
lobby
we
were
treated
as
if
we
were
returning
friends
our
rooms
were
ready
upon
arrival
and
they
were
just
as
impressive
as
when
i
viewed
them
online
the
location
couldngt
be
more
convenient
to
access
all
of
chicagogs
shopping
and
dining
areas
we
dined
in
sestongs
chop
house
which
i
highly
recommend
the
staff
at
the
hotel
are
professionals
who
work
to
make
your
stay
there
a
grand
experience
the
hyatt
regency
chicago
is
the
only
place
we
will
stay
when
we
return
to
the
windy
city

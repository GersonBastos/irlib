in
downtown
within
walking
distance
to
most
major
attractions
such
as
sears

magnificent
mile
grant
millenium
parks
etc
subway
bus
stops
very
close
by
to
travel
to
other
locations
in
the
city
overall
the
hotel
was
very
nice
clean
and
at
a
great
location
was
in
a
safe
area
went
to
beautiful
wrigley
field
and
soldier
field
and
saw
both
teams
play
i
love
chicago

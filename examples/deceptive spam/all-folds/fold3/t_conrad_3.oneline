this
was
a
weekend
trip
for
my
friends
and
i
we
booked
a
couple
of
rooms
and
asked
in
advanced
for
the
reservations
to
be
connected
in
some
way
our
rooms
were
right
next
to
one
another
as
requested
as
it
was
almost
everyonegs
first
time
to
chicago
we
had
to
do
a
bit
of
cold
searching
for
a
hotel
and
our
choice
was
next
to
perfect
i
had
an
amazing
time
during
my
first
visit
to
chicago
and
it
was
largely
due
to
this
hotel
the
customer
service
was
amazing
everyone
was
extremely
nice
and
helpful
one
of
our
rooms
ordered
late
night
room
service
and
raved
about
how
they
felt
they
had
ordered
a
star
lunch
because
it
was
as
fresh
as
having
ordered
food
at
pm
and
delicious
my
friend
suggested
they
had
a
full
staff
at
am
because
the
food
came
up
quickly
too
in
another
of
our
rooms
housekeeping
had
accidentally
discarded
a
cd
when
replacing
the
cd
player
with
an
ipod
dock
the
concierge
had
the
exact
cd
purchased
and
ready
at
check
out
from
the
neighboring
record
store
our
rate
included
complimentary
breakfast
which
was
fantastic
everything
was
freshly
made
in
their
kitchen
too
an
added
bonus
was
that
the
hotel
is
attached
to
a
mall
therefore
you
dongt
need
to
leave
the
building
to
get
a
pair
of
shoes
a
coffee
or
a
some
other
type
of
trinket
i
was
beyond
pleased
with
this
hotel
and
would
stay
here
again
without
hesitation

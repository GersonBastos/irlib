just
back
from
night
stay
at
omni
and
would
thoroughly
recommend
it
staff
bent
over
backwards
to
assist
in
anything
no
matter
how
minute
great
location
on
magnificent
mile
and
lots
to
do
there
both
for
adults
and
my
daughter
if
i
had
to
find
a
fault
it
would
be
the
extra
charges
taxes
etc
for
room
service
bar
and
restaurant
but
where
is
cheap
these
days
would
definitely
recommend
it
especially
for
families

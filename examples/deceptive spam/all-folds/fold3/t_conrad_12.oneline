we
spent
a
week
in
this
hotel
and
were
very
pleased
with
the
experience
as
described
in
previous
reviews
the
room
was
very
comfortable
with
the
huge
televison
and
bathroom
being
particularly
outstanding
service
was
excellent
overall
i
especially
liked
the
bottle
of
water
at
my
bedside
with
the
turn
down
service
the
door
and
bellmen
women
were
particularly
pleasant
and
helpful
and
the
concierge
was
friendly
and
knowledgeable
we
had
completely
satisfactory
though
overpriced
drinks
in
the
bar
but
didngt
eat
at
the
restaurant
the
health
club
was
fine
and
the
equipment
was
well
maintained
while
there
were
only
three
treadmills
and
two
elipitical
steppers
i
never
had
to
wait
for
a
machine
although
it
might
be
a
different
story
in
the
dead
of
a
chicago
winter
one
minor
quibble
i
like
to
have
coffee
first
thing
in
the
morning
and
there
was
no
in
room
coffee
maker
the
restaurant
offered
free
coffee
to
go
but
only
before
eight
am
this
is
a
very
very
comfortable
attractive
hotel
in
a
wonderful
location
chicago
is
an
expensive
city
but
we
felt
that
we
got
a
reasonable
value
for
our
money

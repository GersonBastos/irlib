my
husband
and
i
stayed
at
the
omni
chicago
hotel
last
weekend
and
i
felt
compelled
to
write
a
review
about
this
wonderful
hotel
i
have
to
say
i
was
very
impressed
with
the
cleanliness
and
the
beautiful
decor
of
this
hotel
not
to
mention
the
friendliest
and
most
helpful
staff
i
have
ever
encountered
i
frequently
stay
at
hotels
for
business
but
have
never
had
such
a
wonderful
experience
as
i
did
at
the
omni
chicago
hotel
from
the
minute
we
walked
in
the
beautiful
front
doors
to
the
time
of
our
check
out
we
were
absolutely
treated
like
royalty
this
is
one
hotel
that
i
would
definitely
rate
stars
you
can
be
sure
i
will
absolutely
be
back
in
the
future

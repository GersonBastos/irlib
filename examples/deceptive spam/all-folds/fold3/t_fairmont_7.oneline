we
stayed
at
the
fairmont
two
nights
for
the
sofa
art
fair
at
the
navy
pier
i
was
impressed
that
the
bellman
called
us
by
name
when
he
met
the
taxi
and
pronounced
it
correctly
which
is
quite
unusual
everyone
smiled
and
welcomed
us
the
lobby
looks
clean
and
friendly
not
ultramodern
but
not
at
all
tired
or
worn
our
room
also
clean
and
comfortably
furnished
was
larger
than
we
expected
with
a
clean
modern
bath
and
a
lovely
view
of
the
navy
pier
and
the
lake
we
did
not
eat
at
the
restaurant
but
it
looked
attractive
our
only
problem
was
that
we
had
asked
for
non
feather
pillows
upon
reserving
the
room
upon
checking
in
and
calling
housekeeping
after
waiting
an
hour
we
went
to
bed
the
next
day
the
check
in
desk
person
was
extremely
apologetic
and
by
the
time
we
returned
all
the
feathers
were
replaced
with
foam
and
non
allergenic
materials
the
hotel
is
convenient
to
millenium
park
and
michigan
ave
we
would
stay
there
again
assuming
we
could
get
good
rates

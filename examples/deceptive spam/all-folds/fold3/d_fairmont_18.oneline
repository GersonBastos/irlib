my
husband
and
i
went
to
chicago
for
three
nights
for
a
quick
get
away
we
chose
fairmont
chicago
millennium
park
because
it
was
located
at
the
heart
of
the
city
downtown
chicago
the
hotel
itself
was
very
elegant
and
modern
the
bed
was
extremely
comfortable
and
i
was
able
to
wake
up
with
music
from
my
ipod
i
would
definitely
stay
with
them
again

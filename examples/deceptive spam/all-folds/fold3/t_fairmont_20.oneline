we
got
this
hotel
by
chance
since
we
decided
the
spur
of
the
moment
to
spend
a
nite
in
chicago
on
we
went
thru
priceline
and
was
lucky
to
get
a
room
at
this
hotel
for
only
normal
rate
was
around
the
room
was
superb
on
the
floor
with
a
nice
king
bed
hotel
is
only
about
blocks
to
michigan
ave
so
the
location
is
very
convenient
parking
is
very
expensive
at
a
nite
but
we
parked
right
next
door
at
a
selfpark
for
just
we
decided
to
have
breakfast
at
the
hotel
restaurant
to
save
us
from
walking
elsewhere
we
ordered
the
buckwheat
pan
cakes
and
egg
benedict
they
were
absolutely
delicious
which
stunned
us
since
we
didngt
expect
this
type
of
experience
from
a
hotel
restaurant
especially
for
breakfast
glad
we
didngt
pick
their
breakfast
buffet
since
the
special
menu
is
much
better
i
highly
recommend
this
beautiful
and
cozy
hotel
for
your
chicago
visit

i
stayed
at
the
fairmont
to
attend
a
conference
i
was
very
pleased
with
the
hotel
the
doorman
offered
me
an
umbrella
as
i
headed
out
for
a
walk
and
sure
enough
it
started
to
rain
very
soon
after
i
would
have
been
soaked
with
it
upon
my
return
the
doorman
then
asked
about
my
walk
etc
this
is
reflective
of
all
the
staff
i
encountered
the
front
desk
promptly
checked
me
in
definitely
register
for
their
rewards
program
before
you
arrive
the
complimentary
gym
access
is
excellent
plus
you
save
on
internet
access
fees
which
are
waived
for
members
the
bathroom
and
separate
dressing
areas
were
large
and
convenient
the
only
negative
no
coffee
maker
and
the
starbucks
in
the
adjacent
building
is
closed
on
weekends
since
the
area
corporate
offices
are
closed
those
days
otherwise
my
stay
was
perfect
considering
the
conference
rate
was
per
night

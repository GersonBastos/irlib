i
recently
had
my
wedding
at
the
omni
hotel
in
chicago
and
i
was
more
than
pleased
the
decision
to
use
a
hotel
as
my
wedding
reception
venue
was
at
first
a
hard
one
i
was
worried
that
a
hotel
would
be
too
impersonal
but
once
i
met
with
the
staff
at
the
omni
i
was
certain
that
it
was
the
way
to
go
the
staff
was
so
attentive
and
friendly
and
i
felt
as
if
my
wedding
was
the
most
important
thing
at
the
hotel
i
highly
recommend
the
omni
hotel
in
chicago
brides
will
not
be
dissapointed

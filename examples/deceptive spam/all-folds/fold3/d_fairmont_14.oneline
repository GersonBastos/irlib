my
husband
and
i
visited
the
fairmont
chicago
millennium
park
for
our
honeymoon
the
customer
service
was
amazing
from
the
time
we
booked
our
packege
to
the
time
we
checked
in
everything
was
absolutely
amazing
these
people
were
proficient
respectful
and
very
thoughtful
the
fairmont
had
a
lounge
a
wine
room
a
bar
and
a
restaurant
i
couldngt
decide
where
i
wanted
to
go
first
after
we
put
our
bags
up
we
headed
down
to
the
wine
room
it
was
totally
delicious
we
also
got
free
wine
just
because
it
was
our
honeymoon
then
after
a
few
glasses
of
wine
we
hit
the
spa
once
again
excellent
everything
smells
like
honeysuckle
and
everyone
smiles
all
the
time
we
stayed
in
the
gold
room
although
it
was
a
little
bit
smaller
than
i
thought
it
would
be
i
was
definitely
satisfied
with
the
huge
king
bed
with
even
bigger
pillows
my
husband
and
i
relaxed
in
fluffy
white
bath
robes
while
we
sipped
champagne
while
we
watched
the
sparkling
lights
of
the
city
it
was
a
wonderful
experience
that
i
will
never
forget
four
thumbs
up

located
right
in
the
heart
of
downtown
chicago
i
visited
this
hotel
on
a
business
trip
the
first
things
i
noticed
was
how
friendly
the
staff
is
and
how
clean
the
rooms
are
even
compared
to
other
luxury
hotels
seeing
as
i
had
a
night
layover
before
my
meeting
i
decided
to
stop
by
the
terrace
and
get
a
drink
i
got
a
mojito
and
i
must
say
i
was
very
impressed
igve
had
my
share
of
mojitos
and
it
was
one
of
the
better
ones
once
i
retired
back
to
my
room
i
found
the
sound
system
to
be
excellent
bed
was
soft
and
the
tv
didngt
appear
burned
out
at
all
overall
i
give
this
a
five
out
of
five
the
staff
was
helpful
and
friendly
the
whole
time
and
the
atmosphere
was
perfect
i
wish
i
could
have
stayed
longer

my
stay
at
the
omni
chicago
hotel
was
wonderful
i
had
a
last
minute
business
trip
in
downtown
chicago
and
this
is
the
first
place
i
looked
at
i
looked
at
the
pictures
they
show
online
of
the
rooms
and
the
facility
itself
and
i
simply
fell
in
love
with
the
place
the
indoor
pool
outdoor
sun
decks
massages
this
place
really
has
all
you
could
possibly
need
whether
yougre
on
vacation
or
needing
a
little
stress
relieved
from
a
busy
week
i
mean
they
even
have
high
speed
wireless
internet
i
would
definitely
recommend
the
omni
chicago
hotel
if
you
want
a
great
place
to
stay
near
downtown
chicago

i
just
left
the
conrad
chicago
and
have
nothing
but
good
things
to
say
we
used
hilton
points
to
stay
there
but
paid
to
upgrade
to
a
junior
suite
we
were
in
room
i
would
reccomend
people
ask
for
an
odd
numbered
room
so
that
they
will
have
a
view
looking
north
on
michigan
ave
our
room
was
very
modern
with
large
hd
flat
panel
tv
and
bose
speaker
sound
system
big
windows
that
actually
open
the
bed
lineds
were
very
nice
the
towels
were
ok
the
room
was
clean
and
the
bath
room
had
a
seperate
shower
and
tub
marble
everywhere
robes
slippers
etc
the
work
out
room
was
good
with
different
machines
and
some
free
weights
there
are
clean
towels
in
the
workout
room
too
we
never
ate
in
the
hotel
so
i
cangt
comment
on
the
food
or
the
prices
there
is
a
starbucks
across
the
street
michigan
and
an
espresso
bar
attached
to
the
nordstrom
that
is
on
the
ground
floor
of
the
hotel
it
was
very
nice
to
have
the
little
mall
right
under
the
hotel
the
location
of
the
hotel
could
not
be
better
we
were
walking
distance
to
everything
every
kind
of
shopping
or
dinning
experience
you
could
possibly
want
was
within
miles
over
all
the
hotel
had
a
boutique
feel
to
it
even
though
it
is
part
of
the
hilton
chain

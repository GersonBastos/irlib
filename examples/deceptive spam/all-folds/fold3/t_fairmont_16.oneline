we
went
to
chicago
to
see
an
exhibit
at
the
art
institute
and
selected
the
fairmont
because
it
was
so
close
although
the
lobby
is
still
being
renovated
our
experience
at
the
hotel
was
uniformly
positive
the
room
was
nicely
sized
and
newly
remodeled
and
immaculate
the
only
glitch
involved
getting
the
room
coffee
replenished
the
maid
does
not
do
that
and
by
bedtime
on
the
first
night
we
still
didngt
have
coffee
we
called
the
front
desk
and
they
immediately
delivered
a
fresh
supply
the
restaurant
is
a
little
underwhelming
but
with
so
many
other
places
to
go
within
a
very
few
blocks
we
probably
wouldngt
have
eaten
there
any
more
than
we
did
after
having
stayed
in
close
to
a
dozen
different
chicago
hotels
this
may
be
the
hotel
we
return
to
whenever
we
return

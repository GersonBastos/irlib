this
hotel
is
amazing
i
would
recommend
everyone
to
stay
at
least
one
night
here
if
they
had
the
chance
i
stayed
here
on
my
first
honeymoon
and
they
had
all
the
accommodations
i
expected
plus
more
i
was
floored
by
the
friendliness
of
the
staff
and
they
definitely
went
the
extra
mile
to
make
everything
perfect
without
any
hassle
the
restaurants
at
the
fairmont
were
amazing
as
well
when
staying
at
this
hotel
food
and
wine
at
their
best
are
portrayed
if
i
had
to
make
the
choice
to
stay
here
again
the
only
thing
that
i
would
do
differently
is
schedule
the
stay
to
be
twice
as
long
it
was
so
relaxing
already
booked
another
stay
for
next
year
i
enjoyed
it
so
much

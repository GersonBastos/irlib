my
three
night
stay
at
fairmont
chicago
millennium
park
was
the
perfect
way
to
end
a
weekend
the
hotel
has
a
classy
but
warm
atmosphere
with
color
tones
that
please
the
mind
and
soothe
the
eyes
the
staff
was
ready
to
help
at
any
notice
and
always
greeted
you
with
a
cheerful
smile
the
myspa
was
the
getaway
of
a
life
time
my
only
complaint
would
be
that
the
bed
covers
were
a
bit
too
stiff
as
they
were
new
and
clean
but
the
softness
of
the
bed
whisked
me
away
to
a
deep
slumber
in
no
time
well
worth
the
money
and
i
know
my
next
stay
will
be
much
longer

booked
this
on
priceline
for
an
insanely
low
price
of
a
night
the
bf
and
i
were
amazed
when
we
got
there
the
person
checking
us
in
was
friendly
and
helpful
to
suggest
some
local
nightspots
and
the
room
was
gorgeous
a
nice
upscale
downtown
feel
and
super
comfy
beds
we
had
a
fabulous
view
from
the
floor
that
inlcluded
a
sliver
of
lake
michigan
a
sliver
of
the
taste
of
chicago
crowds
and
some
friendly
office
workers
in
the
builiding
next
door
who
waved
to
us
a
few
times
seriously
we
had
a
pretty
anonymous
experience
the
rest
of
our
stay
which
was
fine
with
us
the
hotel
consists
mainly
of
towers
and
is
like
a
huge
sprawling
city
inside
but
we
werengt
there
to
stay
in
the
hotel
room
the
entire
time
we
like
to
get
out
and
explore
as
much
as
possible
the
location
was
fantastic
easy
walking
distance
to
michigan
avenue
and
the
rest
of
downtown
we
walked
for
blocks
well
into
the
night
and
never
felt
like
we
needed
a
cab
i
also
highly
recommend
the
urban
cruise
on
the
river
the
entrance
is
right
across
from
the
hotel
we
saw
some
amazing
architecture
from
the
boat
and
got
to
cruise
lake
michigan
a
bit
too
dongt
park
your
car
here
if
you
dongt
need
to
itgs
very
expensive
park
downtown
or
ditch
the
rental
car
you
wongt
need
it
anyway
you
can
walk
to
tons
of
stuff
or
grab
a
cab
love
chicago
and
totally
recommend
this
hotel

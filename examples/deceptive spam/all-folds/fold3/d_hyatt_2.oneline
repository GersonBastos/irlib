my
husband
and
i
stayed
at
the
hyatt
regency
chicago
to
celebrate
our
ten
year
anniversary
we
could
not
have
picked
a
better
locate
the
price
of
the
hotel
was
really
affordable
for
a
couple
on
a
tight
budget
the
flat
screen
television
and
the
comfortable
beds
were
a
favorite
of
mine
my
husband
loved
the
stetson
steakhouse
and
the
hour
stay
fit
gym
we
really
did
not
leave
the
hotel
during
i
stay
there
because
basically
everything
you
need
is
only
a
walk
or
phone
call
away
if
we
ever
travel
to
this
area
again
this
would
be
my
first
and
only
pick
for
a
wonderful
stay
this
hotel
gets
four
thumbs
up
from
my
husband
and
i
what
a
wonderful
ten
years
celebration

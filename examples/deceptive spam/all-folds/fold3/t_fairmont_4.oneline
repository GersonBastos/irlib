nestled
just
off
the
beaten
path
and
about
two
blocks
from
the
river
the
fairmont
chicago
offers
an
excellent
location
to
operate
as
home
base
for
your
trip
to
chicago
the
staff
were
friendly
and
helpful
arranging
many
of
the
sightseeing
events
we
enjoyed
while
in
the
city
there
are
many
attractions
withiin
easy
walking
distance
the
art
institute
is
a
must
see
and
millenium
park
is
a
fun
visit
the
architectural
tour
by
river
departs
a
dock
that
is
very
close
to
the
fairmont
and
there
are
lots
of
restaurants
nearby
the
rooms
were
excellent
and
the
club
room
is
worth
the
extra
expense
we
would
definitely
stay
here
again

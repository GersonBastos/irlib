we
arrived
at
am
on
a
friday
and
they
had
a
room
ready
for
us
by
am
mind
you
check
in
is
not
until
we
got
our
room
on
priceline
for
per
night
and
stayed
nights
we
were
upgraded
for
free
to
a
suite
i
think
i
was
so
blown
away
by
that
that
i
forgot
to
thank
them
at
check
in
our
room
was
fantastic
it
also
had
a
wet
bar
and
a
fridge
the
bathroom
was
quite
large
and
had
a
nice
sized
closet
with
many
hangers
i
knew
from
previous
reviews
to
not
touch
the
mini
bar
the
bed
and
pillows
were
very
comfortable
the
room
was
very
clean
every
employee
there
went
out
of
their
way
to
be
friendly
and
helpful
we
stayed
on
the
floor
of
the
east
tower
and
had
a
quiet
room
yes
you
could
hear
people
in
the
hallways
but
only
because
they
were
rude
and
were
yelling
these
were
not
children
they
were
adults
i
dongt
know
why
everyone
complains
about
for
parking
this
is
chicago
and
every
other
hotel
we
saw
charged
just
as
much
some
without
in
out
privledges
we
didngt
use
any
of
the
restaurants
or
the
health
club
we
tried
to
eat
at
the
corner
bakery
but
it
was
too
crowded
breakfast
at
nearby
houlihangs
had
a
buffet
for
per
person
also
the
grocery
store
behind
the
hotel
is
great
there
is
a
not
too
far
away
i
dongt
know
why
there
are
so
many
bad
reviews
on
this
hotel
yes
itgs
a
big
hotel
if
you
dongt
want
a
busy
lobby
dongt
stay
in
a
plus
room
hotel
i
loved
the
hotel
and
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
not
one
problem
wasngt
too
busy
for
me
would
stay
here
again
in
a
heartbeat

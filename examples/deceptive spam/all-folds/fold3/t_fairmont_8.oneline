the
concierge
was
so
helpful
without
hesitation
they
had
the
best
recommendations
for
restaurants
and
attractions
all
turning
out
to
be
wonderful
they
even
gave
us
business
cards
for
restaurants
that
did
not
take
reservations
so
we
could
obtain
preferential
or
immediate
seatinggs
loved
the
health
club
at
the
back
of
the
hotel
by
joining
the
presidents
club
it
only
cost
ten
dollars
a
day
to
use
the
facilities
the
rooms
were
large
updated
and
had
views
looking
out
in
directions
the
coffee
maker
in
the
room
was
exceptional
location
is
great
for
getting
mostly
anywhere
parking
is
overpriced
so
we
took
our
cart
to
the
underground
millennium
garage
that
was
only
per
hours
and
a
few
blocks
walk
from
the
hotel

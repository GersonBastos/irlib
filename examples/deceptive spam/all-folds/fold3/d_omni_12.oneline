i
truly
enjoyed
my
stay
at
the
omni
chicago
hotel
we
stayed
in
a
suite
which
was
clean
and
extremely
nice
at
a
very
reasonable
rate
my
husband
and
i
spent
quite
a
bit
of
time
in
the
indoor
pool
but
personally
i
preferred
laying
out
on
the
sundeck
service
was
excellentg
they
were
friendly
and
all
of
our
needs
were
met
promptly
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
hotel
to
anyone
looking
to
have
a
great
experience
in
the
downtown
chicago
area

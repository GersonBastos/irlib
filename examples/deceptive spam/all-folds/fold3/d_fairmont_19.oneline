i
had
to
write
this
review
my
tired
body
walked
through
the
doors
of
the
fairmont
it
felt
like
i
walked
through
heavengs
gates
the
lobby
was
majestic
and
the
staff
was
so
friendly
that
i
was
instantly
energized
the
front
desk
staff
was
very
helpful
and
quick
to
find
my
reservation
and
get
my
bags
up
to
my
room
they
were
so
nice
to
inform
me
of
the
health
club
and
spa
oh
those
wonderful
spa
treatments
that
are
offered
are
incredible
i
took
advantage
of
a
soothing
pedicure
during
my
visit
my
very
first
as
well
as
a
massage
i
was
amazed
at
the
size
of
the
meeting
conference
room
that
we
used
for
an
afternoon
the
room
was
so
clean
and
the
bed
was
better
than
the
one
at
home
the
food
downstairs
in
the
restaurant
smelled
so
good
that
as
tired
as
i
was
after
the
meeting
instead
of
room
service
i
went
in
and
the
food
was
mouth
watering
delicious
and
the
wait
staff
was
very
hospitable
they
take
great
pride
in
everything
even
the
wake
up
call
was
friendly
my
stay
was
so
great
that
i
want
to
go
back
again
soon

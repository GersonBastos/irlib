the
talbott
hotel
was
very
classy
professional
and
luxurious
i
loved
how
the
staff
was
nice
and
respectful
i
was
treated
like
i
was
royalty
when
i
was
there
when
in
checked
i
was
greeted
by
all
of
the
people
working
behind
the
front
desk
and
was
offered
a
tour
of
the
hotel
they
took
my
bags
and
put
them
in
my
room
while
i
was
taking
the
tour
and
they
even
escorted
me
to
my
room
right
after
we
were
done
this
is
a
very
nice
and
modern
looking
and
their
rooms
are
spacious
and
clean
unlike
other
hotels
in
their
area
i
have
recommended
this
hotel
to
all
of
my
family
and
friends
and
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
is
going
to
stay
in
that
area

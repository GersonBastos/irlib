at
the
last
minute
my
son
and
i
decided
to
take
a
quick
trip
to
chicago
to
see
the
cubs
after
checking
priceline
i
decided
to
book
the
omni
because
of
the
great
price
for
airfare
and
hotel
we
arrived
at
the
hotel
around
noon
and
our
room
was
ready
i
had
called
ahead
and
requested
early
arrival
the
front
desk
treated
us
like
we
were
there
best
customers
very
friendly
and
accomodating
the
room
was
wonderful
with
all
the
modern
conviences
you
would
expect
in
an
upscale
hotel
the
room
was
spotless
and
the
bed
was
very
comfortable
there
was
not
one
sign
of
bed
bugs
as
mentioned
in
a
previous
review
maybe
those
bed
bugs
were
from
their
luggage
and
were
transferred
into
their
room
we
then
went
to
the
hotel
restaurant
and
had
lunch
our
service
was
great
as
was
the
food
we
also
tried
several
restaurants
around
the
omni
all
within
walking
distance
the
service
cleanliness
and
location
of
the
omni
were
incredible
we
will
definitely
go
back

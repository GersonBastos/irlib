we
got
a
great
deal
on
this
hotel
just
found
through
travelzoo
we
only
stayed
one
night
but
were
very
impressed
the
sevice
was
fantastic
from
the
moment
we
stepped
up
to
the
property
the
hotel
smelled
wonderful
and
was
immaculate
our
room
while
not
enormous
was
perfect
we
had
a
great
view
of
the
city
and
lake
the
bed
was
extremely
comfortable
we
never
heard
any
noise
outside
of
our
room
the
bathroom
was
nice
sized
considering
we
must
have
had
one
of
the
smaller
rooms
in
the
hotel
two
could
get
ready
very
comfortably
location
was
perfect
just
off
michigan
ave
and
steps
away
from
millenium
park
we
would
definetly
stay
here
again
especially
if
we
could
get
this
great
deal

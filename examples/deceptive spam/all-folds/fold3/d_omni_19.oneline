my
family
and
i
vacation
in
chicago
and
stayed
at
the
omni
chicago
hotel
upon
our
arrival
we
were
greeted
happily
and
the
kids
received
free
bagpacks
for
their
stay
which
they
loved
the
staff
was
great
and
always
greeted
us
as
we
walked
in
and
out
of
the
hotel
they
even
remembered
our
names
the
location
of
the
hotel
was
amazing
right
on
the
magnificent
mile
we
really
enjoyed
our
stay
and
the
kids
loved
the
indoor
pool
i
would
definitely
stay
there
again
if
i
have
the
chance
and
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
i
know
going
to
the
chicago
area

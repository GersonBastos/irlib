the
hyatt
regency
in
chicago
was
a
wonderful
experience
for
my
husband
and
i
as
we
traveled
through
the
area
on
vacation
after
checking
in
we
simply
relaxed
in
the
beautiful
atrium
for
a
while
before
going
to
our
room
to
our
delight
the
room
was
very
clean
ultra
modern
and
furnished
with
sleek
and
comfortable
furniture
what
really
impressed
us
about
the
room
was
how
spacious
it
was
and
the
stunning
river
front
views
we
were
pressed
for
time
to
make
dinner
so
decided
the
bistro
sounded
like
the
best
option
and
it
turned
out
to
be
a
great
choice
the
food
was
simply
fabulous
after
dinner
we
were
able
to
try
out
the
fitness
center
which
ended
up
making
our
gym
at
home
seem
inadequate
this
was
just
what
we
needed
as
a
restful
base
for
our
chicago
vacation
and
we
will
definitely
stay
here
again

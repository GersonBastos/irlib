i
recently
stayed
at
the
hyatt
regency
in
downtown
chicago
my
stay
here
was
wonderful
thanks
to
such
a
friendly
staff
i
needed
to
do
some
research
for
work
and
the
free
wi
fi
made
this
very
easy
the
bed
was
so
nice
and
soft
even
the
pillows
were
fluffy
i
was
able
to
put
my
valuables
in
the
in
room
safe
the
local
restaurants
were
amazing
i
will
recommend
this
to
my
friends
and
i
am
staying
here
again
in
the
future

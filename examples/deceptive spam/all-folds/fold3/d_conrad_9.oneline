i
went
to
stay
at
this
hotel
last
year
i
have
got
to
say
it
was
a
great
authentic
experience
the
dining
restaurant
was
clean
and
fantastic
the
rooms
were
very
comfortable
with
a
friendly
staff
its
location
couldngt
be
more
perfect
so
close
you
can
walk
to
do
some
shopping
looking
at
it
from
the
outside
at
night
is
very
beautiful
it
is
very
affordable
i
recommend
this
place
to
anyone
and
plan
on
staying
again
the
next
time
i
come
to
town

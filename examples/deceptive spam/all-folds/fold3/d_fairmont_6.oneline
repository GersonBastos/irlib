we
recently
stayed
at
the
fairmont
chicago
millennium
park
while
travelling
for
business
what
an
incredible
experience
friends
had
stayed
there
years
ago
but
when
we
showed
them
our
photos
they
couldngt
believe
the
amazing
renovations
while
we
loved
the
modern
decor
and
style
our
main
reason
for
choosing
this
hotel
was
because
of
what
they
call
fairmont
pure
rooms
i
have
had
so
many
awful
allergy
attacks
while
travelling
so
i
wasngt
too
optimistic
that
they
could
actually
make
a
truly
hypoallergenic
and
allergy
free
room
i
have
to
say
i
felt
great
during
our
entire
stay
we
enjoyed
a
delicious
bottle
of
wine
and
incredible
cheese
and
appetizers
at
eno
what
a
treat
to
get
such
amazing
food
and
wine
without
even
having
to
walk
out
of
the
hotel
this
hotel
is
truly
beautiful
everything
you
would
expect
from
a
high
end
big
city
hotel
our
stay
at
the
fairmont
chicago
millennium
park
didngt
disappoint
us
in
any
respect
our
only
disappointment
we
dongt
have
a
reason
to
go
back
to
chicago
anytime
soon
but
i
have
a
feeling
we
will
be
making
reservations
for
another
visit
in
the
very
near
future

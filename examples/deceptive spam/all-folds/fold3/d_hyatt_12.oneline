my
girlfriends
and
i
stayed
at
the
hyatt
in
chicago
during
a
shopping
trip
to
the
city
in
june
we
found
a
great
deal
on
orbitz
com
and
decided
to
give
it
a
try
the
location
was
perfect
just
off
michigan
avenue
on
the
chicago
river
so
it
was
easy
to
walk
down
the
mag
mile
and
get
to
all
of
the
shops
without
having
to
pay
for
cabs
or
rent
a
car
the
hotel
is
right
next
the
the
palm
restaurant
and
within
walking
distance
of
several
places
to
eat
both
fancy
china
grill
yum
and
affordable
corner
bakery
the
rooms
have
been
recently
remodeled
and
were
clean
and
spacious
we
were
lucky
to
get
a
room
with
a
good
view
be
sure
to
ask
that
you
do
not
have
a
view
of
the
office
building
next
door
the
lobby
is
typical
hyatt
big
and
spacious
with
lots
of
plants
service
was
good
all
around
an
excellent
experience
and
a
great
deal

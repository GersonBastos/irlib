from
the
moment
i
stepped
into
the
hotel
i
felt
like
i
was
walking
into
my
own
castle
and
everyone
was
there
to
serve
me
checking
in
was
done
in
a
matter
of
seconds
and
the
receptionists
were
very
friendly
i
only
had
one
bag
with
me
but
they
still
insisted
on
helping
me
carry
it
to
my
room
which
i
loved
since
i
had
just
had
quite
a
long
flight
and
made
sure
i
had
everything
i
needed
before
wishing
me
a
happy
stay
in
the
hyatt
regency
chicago
after
settling
in
and
resting
for
a
while
i
called
room
service
and
ordered
some
dinner
which
was
provided
very
quickly
and
tasted
like
something
out
of
a
star
restaurant
overall
my
experience
was
very
positive
and
i
would
be
glad
to
return
to
the
hyatt
upon
my
next
visit

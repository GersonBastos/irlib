overall
the
hotel
is
beautiful
the
service
was
great
all
the
employees
were
friendly
and
always
willing
to
help
my
room
on
the
north
end
had
a
great
view
of
the
city
and
the
chicago
river
the
bed
and
big
fluffy
pillows
were
very
comfortable
and
relaxing
the
only
downfalls
were
parking
and
the
fitness
room
parking
was
a
little
on
the
pricey
side
and
not
exactly
as
close
to
the
hotel
as
one
would
think
it
should
be
the
hotel
itself
is
huge
with
over
rooms
so
you
may
feel
like
your
getting
your
daily
exercise
in
just
walking
from
your
room
to
the
fitness
center
depending
on
where
your
room
is
located

i
never
thought
igd
be
able
to
stay
at
a
hotel
and
feel
completely
at
home
i
am
a
mother
of
two
children
one
of
which
has
severe
asthma
and
allergies
i
have
spent
more
time
in
hospital
emergency
rooms
than
my
own
living
room
for
the
past
two
and
a
half
years
so
when
my
sister
was
getting
married
in
chicago
i
was
extremely
anxious
the
front
desk
associate
rosa
was
wonderful
she
told
me
that
they
have
allergy
friendly
rooms
no
perfumes
no
harsh
cleaning
chemicals
no
dreaded
industry
standard
feather
pillows
i
booked
a
room
but
was
still
really
worried
i
shouldngt
have
been
ethan
breathed
as
easily
in
that
beautiful
room
as
he
did
in
our
own
home
maybe
even
a
little
better
they
had
an
air
purification
system
for
our
room
it
smelled
so
fresh
while
my
husband
took
our
daughter
to
the
big
bar
for
nachos
she
never
stopped
talking
about
how
totally
cool
it
was
i
ordered
room
service
for
my
son
the
man
who
answered
the
phone
was
so
patient
and
accommodating
my
son
has
a
lot
of
food
allergies
so
i
was
pretty
much
ordering
off
menu
with
specific
details
thatgs
always
a
little
humbling
but
the
staff
treated
my
order
with
the
grace
as
though
they
did
special
orders
all
the
time
i
was
actually
able
to
enjoy
my
sistergs
wedding
the
only
problem
with
my
stay
is
that
it
was
too
short
wegre
coming
back
for
our
first
family
vacation
since
ethan
was
born
thank
you
hyatt
regency
chicago
for
making
this
familygs
visit
possible
and
positive

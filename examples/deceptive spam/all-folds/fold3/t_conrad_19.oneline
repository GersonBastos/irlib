we
usually
stay
at
the
sofitel
but
thought
we
would
try
the
conrad
for
a
change
i
dongt
think
i
would
rate
this
hotel
over
the
sofitel
but
it
was
still
class
but
i
do
think
the
service
was
better
at
the
conrad
we
arrived
at
the
hotel
just
before
the
restaurant
closed
and
soon
we
were
the
only
table
left
normally
service
goes
down
hill
then
but
our
waiter
eric
was
the
best
even
when
i
kept
ordering
my
after
dinner
ports
the
meal
may
not
have
been
the
chop
house
but
it
was
still
very
good
the
bar
was
ok
no
crown
reserve
they
did
have
the
cask
at
a
drink
ouch
the
room
service
was
very
quick
our
room
was
very
clean
and
the
maids
replace
everything
including
the
ashtrays
during
their
visits
the
only
fault
we
could
find
was
the
temperature
on
the
floor
it
was
so
hot
that
we
had
our
window
open
the
whole
time
with
the
heat
turned
completely
off
which
wasngt
so
bad
since
my
wife
smokes
the
temp
on
the
where
the
lobby
bar
and
restaurant
was
fine
we
enjoyed
the
hotel
enough
that
we
will
be
back
in
sept
one
last
thing
if
you
like
a
cheap
fantastic
breakfast
go
to
the
west
egg
only
a
few
blocks
away

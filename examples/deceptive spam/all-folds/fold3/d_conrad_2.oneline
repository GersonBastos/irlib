i
had
a
great
experience
staying
at
the
conrad
chicago
the
service
was
top
notch
the
price
was
good
but
out
of
everything
the
service
was
outstanding
i
would
definitely
stay
there
again
when
in
the
area
and
would
suggest
it
to
anyone
looking
for
a
good
quality
hotel
in
a
great
location
right
next
to
the
shops
at
north
bridge

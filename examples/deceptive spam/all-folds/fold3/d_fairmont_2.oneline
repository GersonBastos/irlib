i
have
just
returned
from
my
first
stay
at
the
remodeled
fairmont
chicago
millennium
park
and
all
i
can
say
is
fabulous
the
modern
decor
and
style
hits
you
the
minute
you
walk
in
the
front
desk
is
a
work
of
art
i
stayed
in
the
anything
but
standard
guestroom
the
modern
decor
the
beautiful
artwork
this
is
the
most
relaxing
hotel
room
i
have
ever
stayed
in
the
bathroom
is
like
having
your
own
personal
spa
all
the
marble
tile
is
classic
and
modern
at
the
same
time
the
rainfall
showerhead
is
to
die
for
people
if
you
have
the
time
be
sure
to
check
out
the
fitness
center
and
spa
great
new
equipment
to
work
up
a
sweat
and
all
the
pampering
a
body
could
ever
needs
awaits
in
the
spa
i
wish
i
could
have
stayed
longer
next
time
i
will
be
sure
to
add
a
couple
of
me
days
to
my
trip
and
igm
sure
i
wongt
even
think
of
going
outside
those
doors

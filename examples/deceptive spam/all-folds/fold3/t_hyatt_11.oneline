i
booked
a
room
at
the
hyatt
through
priceline
and
was
able
to
get
a
rate
of
cangt
go
wrong
with
that
the
rooms
are
nice
spacious
clean
and
contain
all
the
amenties
a
traveler
would
need
i
have
to
say
that
i
have
fallen
in
love
with
the
hyatt
chain
due
to
their
customer
service
i
have
stayed
at
a
few
of
their
hotels
in
different
cities
and
the
staff
has
always
been
extremely
friendly
which
you
dongt
often
see
at
other
hotels
i
used
the
self
check
in
machine
and
the
customer
service
person
checked
in
on
me
to
make
sure
everything
was
going
smoothly
then
when
she
saw
that
my
room
was
not
on
a
high
level
she
offered
to
have
it
changed
for
me
so
that
i
could
have
a
better
view
i
would
highly
recommend
this
hotel

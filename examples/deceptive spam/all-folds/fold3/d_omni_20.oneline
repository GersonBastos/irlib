the
omni
chicago
is
hands
down
the
best
hotel
in
my
opinion
in
the
chicago
area
i
am
a
neat
freak
but
here
you
need
not
worry
about
cleanliness
as
they
are
the
best
at
keeping
the
rooms
tidy
our
check
in
was
easy
and
fast
and
the
staff
at
the
hotel
was
very
courteous
and
friendly
i
forgot
my
hair
dryer
but
thankfully
one
of
the
many
perks
at
this
hotel
they
provide
one
for
you
in
your
room
thatgs
a
small
benefit
compared
to
the
lucious
pool
and
dreamy
massages
they
offer
i
have
never
had
a
massage
like
that
before
my
favortie
thing
about
the
omni
is
the
high
speed
wireless
internet
that
is
available
to
all
guests
i
am
able
to
do
my
work
online
in
all
areas
of
the
hotel
which
saved
me
a
lot
of
time
as
i
was
not
at
my
office
but
still
had
a
lot
of
work
to
get
done
i
also
loved
the
tv
they
provide
in
the
room
a
big
plasma
with
a
beautiful
crisp
picture
i
dongt
even
have
that
at
home
needless
to
say
i
spent
almost
all
night
lounging
in
the
comfortable
bed
watching
movies
only
to
fall
asleep
and
wake
up
to
the
newspaper
delivered
to
my
hotel
door
in
the
morning
i
will
be
coming
back
to
the
omni
on
my
next
trip
to
chicago
thatgs
a
promise

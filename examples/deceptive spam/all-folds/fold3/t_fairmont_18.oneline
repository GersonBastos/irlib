my
husband
and
i
were
in
the
fairmont
chicago
recently
for
a
conference
we
stayed
in
a
spacious
suite
all
amenities
appeared
recently
updated
and
in
excellent
shape
the
bed
was
very
comfortable
views
were
great
i
love
their
products
in
the
bathroom
and
used
them
in
the
pristine
tub
two
out
of
three
nights
the
room
was
so
quiet
it
was
very
relaxing
we
ate
in
the
restaurant
downstairs
aria
and
although
pricey
it
was
excellent
the
staff
were
consistently
attentive
and
responsive
it
is
evident
that
everyone
is
very
well
trained
i
would
love
to
stay
here
again

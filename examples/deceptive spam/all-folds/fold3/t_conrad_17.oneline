we
stayed
for
a
one
night
getaway
with
family
on
a
thursday
triple
aaa
rate
of
was
a
steal
floor
room
complete
with
plasma
tv
bose
stereo
voss
and
evian
water
and
gorgeous
bathroom
no
tub
but
was
fine
for
us
concierge
was
very
helpful
you
cannot
beat
this
location
only
flaw
was
breakfast
was
pricey
and
service
was
very
very
slow
for
four
kids
and
four
adults
on
a
friday
morning
even
though
there
were
only
two
other
tables
in
the
restaurant
food
was
very
good
so
it
was
worth
the
wait

would
return
in
a
heartbeat
a
gem
in
chicago

my
husband
and
i
recently
visited
the
fairmont
chicago
millennium
park
hotel
on
one
of
his
business
trips
i
sometimes
go
along
with
him
to
see
new
places
and
to
splurge
on
a
mini
vacation
while
he
is
hard
at
work
dongt
worry
he
likes
when
i
return
with
little
souvenirs
for
him
too
aside
from
the
lovely
city
of
chicago
this
hotel
was
just
amazing
we
had
gotten
in
quite
late
that
evening
from
our
flight
from
houston
and
were
so
tired
the
staff
was
genuine
and
friendly
all
while
being
professional
and
prompt
we
were
quickly
checked
in
and
before
we
knew
it
we
were
in
our
beautiful
room
too
tired
to
really
take
it
in
we
were
in
bed
and
asleep
in
minutes
the
beds
were
quite
welcoming
it
wasngt
until
the
next
morning
that
we
were
able
to
really
take
in
all
of
the
beautiful
features
of
this
hotel
itgs
gorgeous
everything
was
so
clean
and
wonderfully
decorated
the
lobby
somehow
didngt
make
it
into
our
sleepy
eyes
the
night
before
but
it
was
just
lovely
later
that
evening
we
decided
to
eat
at
their
sushi
restaurant
sushi
is
one
of
my
husbandgs
favorites
so
he
tends
to
be
picky
they
passed
the
test
according
to
him
we
also
enjoyed
a
glass
of
wine
there
as
well
everything
tasted
great
and
was
of
excellent
quality
of
our
two
night
stay
there
the
only
downfall
was
one
occasion
of
there
not
being
enough
towels
i
use
a
lot
of
towels
i
suppose
however
a
simple
phone
called
prompted
a
quick
delivery
of
fluffy
additional
ones
this
however
was
only
a
minor
bump
in
the
road
to
an
entirely
enjoyable
and
relaxing
stay
overall
wegd
love
to
go
there
again
maybe
next
time
i
can
talk
my
husband
into
taking
advantage
of
the
spa

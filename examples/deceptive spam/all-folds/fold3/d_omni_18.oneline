i
had
to
go
down
to
chicago
one
weekend
for
the
graduation
ceremony
of
my
cousin
it
was
a
sudden
trip
and
i
didngt
even
have
the
time
to
book
a
hotel
before
hand
when
i
showed
up
in
chicago
and
asked
my
taxi
driver
to
take
me
to
the
nearest
good
hotel
he
took
me
to
omni
chicago
hotel
i
was
impressed
with
how
clean
it
was
and
they
didngt
have
a
problem
with
getting
me
a
room
even
though
i
didngt
have
a
reservation
the
staff
was
friendly
to
me
the
entire
time
i
was
in
the
hotel
which
was
just
a
short
two
nights
and
the
cleaning
service
was
top
notch

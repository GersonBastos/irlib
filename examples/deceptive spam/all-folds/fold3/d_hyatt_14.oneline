the
hyatt
regency
chicago
hotel
was
a
delight
to
stay
at
igve
never
been
to
chicago
before
but
the
location
was
fantastic
they
had
all
sorts
of
different
rooms
from
non
smoking
to
smoking
to
hypo
allergenic
rooms
igve
never
seen
so
many
options
for
rooms
the
room
i
stayed
in
was
well
worth
the
nightly
price
the
location
was
so
close
to
all
the
activities
my
husband
and
i
had
planned
for
our
vacation
we
have
never
been
treated
so
much
like
royalty
than
at
the
chicago
hyatt
regency

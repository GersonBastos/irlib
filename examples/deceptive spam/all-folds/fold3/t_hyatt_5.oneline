we
paid
a
night
through
priceline
which
is
excellent
for
june
our
room
had
a
fantastic
view
of
the
hancock
building
and
the
river
the
room
was
large
clean
and
had
a
couch
easy
chair
and
desk
chair
the
bedding
was
the
newer
gnon
bedspreadg
style
the
bed
was
comfortable
the
bathroom
was
large
and
well
we
were
pleased
with
the
room
and
the
hyatt
in
every
way
we
ate
at
the
lobby
restaurant
which
is
attractively
decorated
and
was
bustling
with
activity
when
we
were
there
we
only
got
cobb
salads
so
i
dongt
know
if
the
food
in
general
is
good
or
not
the
cobb
was
so
so
our
only
complaint
was
the
fee
to
park
your
car
over
night
and
the
daily
fee
for
the
internet
many
places
are
offering
free
internet
these
days
and
i
wish
the
hyatt
would
hop
on
board
with
this
concept
we
hated
to
leave

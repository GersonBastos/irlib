the
fairmont
chicago
millenium
park
hotel
provides
a
rich
beautiful
cultured
atmosphere
during
my
stay
i
felt
like
royalty
with
unparalleled
design
schemes
and
beautiful
tranquil
views
the
mood
during
my
entire
stay
was
one
of
bliss
the
guest
services
department
was
second
to
none
the
staff
throughout
the
hotel
were
obviously
concerned
with
pleasing
the
customer
and
making
my
stay
as
wonderful
as
possible
when
dealing
with
a
staff
member
at
fairmont
i
felt
as
if
i
were
the
only
guest
in
the
place
the
food
and
drink
selections
were
vast
and
fit
for
a
king
i
will
definitely
recommend
fairmont
chicago
millenium
park
to
my
friends
and
colleagues
i
will
also
greatly
look
forward
to
my
next
stay

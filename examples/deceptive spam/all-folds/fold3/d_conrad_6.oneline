having
recently
been
in
chicago
for
business
and
based
on
proximity
and
aesthetics
i
decided
to
reserve
a
room
at
the
conrad
hotel
in
chicago
and
i
couldngt
have
been
more
delighted
with
every
aspect
of
my
two
night
stay
every
conceivable
amenity
is
available
from
the
plasma
flat
screen
to
both
wired
and
wireless
internet
connections
available
i
was
able
to
stay
in
constant
contact
with
the
office
all
while
in
the
enviable
lap
of
luxury
my
room
was
not
only
comfortable
and
clean
but
warm
and
inviting
just
as
if
it
were
home
away
from
home
if
yougre
in
the
chicago
area
reserve
a
room
at
the
conrad
hotels
and
resorts
and
you
will
not
be
disappointed

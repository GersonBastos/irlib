was
beautiful
and
spacious

had
the
largest
flat
screen
tv
i
have
ever
seen
in
a
hotel
great
excuse
to
catch
up
on
some
movies
the
breakfast
buffet
was
great
and
was
served
in
the
hotels
huge
atrium
which
was
nice
the
service
was
top
notch
stayed
in
a
lower
floor
in
the
east
tower
which
was
great
as
there
was
no
waits
for
an
elevator
and
they
were
always
empty
the
shed

was
a
complete
waste
of
time

money

remains
tied

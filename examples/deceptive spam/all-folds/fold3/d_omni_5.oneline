we
stayed
at
the
omni
chicago
hotel
recently
and
had
a
great
experience
my
husband
and
i
would
highly
recommend
this
hotel
to
anyone
visiting
downtown
chicago
we
are
frequent
travelers
who
are
used
to
staying
in
well
maintained
luxury
properties
with
many
amenities
and
the
omni
chicago
definitely
fit
the
bill
first
of
all
the
hotel
is
all
suites
we
stayed
in
one
of
the
premium
suites
the
accommodations
were
definitely
luxurious
with
premium
bedding
very
nice
robes
for
our
use
and
a
choice
of
pillows
we
used
the
hypo
allergenic
ones
but
i
believe
you
could
have
also
chosen
foam
or
feathers
we
were
pleased
to
find
that
the
tv
was
plasma
we
have
found
that
not
all
hotels
have
upgraded
to
plasma
and
we
dongt
wish
to
use
one
of
the
old
fashioned
type
of
tvs
anymore
now
that
we
are
so
used
to
plasma
at
home
there
were
actually
two
tvs
in
our
suite
there
were
also
some
additional
amenities
that
we
appreciated
such
as
high
speed
internet
access
a
wet
bar
an
indoor
swimming
pool
and
two
gorgeous
sundecks
for
relaxing
outside
the
location
was
perfect
as
it
was
right
in
the
midst
of
the
miracle
mile
with
so
much
to
do
practically
at
the
omnigs
doorstep
i
also
treated
myself
to
the
windy
city
massage
which
was
done
in
the
comfort
and
luxury
of
our
suite
the
masseuse
was
excellent
and
she
used
very
high
quality
products
for
my
sensitive
skin
it
was
extremely
relaxing
and
i
was
so
pleased
to
find
out
that
i
could
get
this
at
the
omni
it
was
easy
for
us
to
see
why
the
omni
came
so
highly
recommended
i
also
wanted
to
mention
that
the
staff
was
very
helpful
and
friendly
recommending
several
excellent
area
restaurants
however
we
think
our
best
meal
was
at
the
omnigs
restaurant
where
my
husband
raved
about
the
bone
in
ribeye
and
i
had
the
carrot
soup
and
the
lake
erie
silver
bass
they
had
an
extensive
wine
list
and
we
were
easily
able
to
choose
wines
we
loved
with
the
staffgs
guidance
lastly
the
hotel
staff
also
highly
recommended
we
visit
the
nearby
art
institute
of
chicago
which
was
a
highlight
of
our
trip
we
loved
that
there
were
multiple
museums
so
close
to
the
omni
we
will
be
frequent
visitors
at
the
omni
in
the
future
where
i
will
definitely
be
getting
the
in
room
massage
again
we
are
going
to
pass
this
recommendation
on
to
all
of
our
friends
and
family
choose
the
omni
for
a
great
chicago
experience

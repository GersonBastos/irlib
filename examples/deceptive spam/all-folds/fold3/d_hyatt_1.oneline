my
experience
at
the
hyatt
regency
chicago
was
simply
amazing
i
had
a
wonderful
stay
there
will
my
husband
my
husband
has
allergy
problems
nearly
everywhere
we
go
and
we
were
worried
about
that
so
we
talked
to
the
desk
clerk
there
they
were
able
to
provide
us
with
a
hyatt
allergy
friendly
room
we
were
so
relieved
and
the
room
was
beautiful
the
furniture
in
the
room
was
actually
cleaned
with
pure
tea
tree
oil
it
was
the
most
comfortable
stay
we
have
ever
had
on
top
of
that
my
husband
had
to
spend
some
time
in
the
room
working
on
some
business
so
the
high
speed
internet
they
provided
was
very
convenient
we
took
full
advantage
of
the
hour
room
service
i
will
definitely
stay
there
again
it
is
a
vacation
simply
staying
in
your
hotel
room

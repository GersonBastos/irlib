i
went
to
chicago
on
business
last
year
and
i
had
the
pleasure
of
staying
at
the
luxurious
hyatt
regency
hotel
i
opted
for
the
business
plan
although
they
have
many
different
room
descriptions
available
to
choose
from
such
as
the
allergy
friendly
monarch
suite
state
suite
all
the
way
up
to
the
presidential
suite
my
suite
was
a
perfect
blend
of
business
and
comfort
equipped
with
wi
fi
a
generous
inch
television
spacious
work
area
and
two
queen
sized
beds
you
sink
into
feeling
tension
ease
from
your
body
i
dined
at
the
stetsongs
chop
shop
restaurant
and
the
meal
was
portioned
generously
and
very
well
prepared
the
staff
was
curtious
and
accommodating
for
breakfast
i
opted
to
have
my
meal
brought
to
my
room
where
i
started
my
business
day
over
a
delicious
hot
meal
and
strong
gourmet
coffee
i
would
highly
recommend
this
wonderful
haven
to
anyone
planning
an
overnight
chicago
stay

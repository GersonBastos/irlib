my
wife
and
i
stayed
at
this
hotel
at
the
end
of
may
she
came
for
the
weekend
for
a
function
and
we
extended
the
trip
to
take
in
the
city
we
got
a
deal
on
this
hotel
through
travelzoos
stay
for
plus
we
got
the
full
buffet
breakfast
the
room
was
wonderful
extremely
large
king
size
bed
with
expansive
sitting
area
we
are
used
to
smaller
hotels
with
little
room
to
move
the
bed
was
extremely
comfortable
with
lots
of
pillows
no
wear
or
damage
in
room
at
all
except
sink
tap
dripped
a
bit
poor
taps
we
could
have
upgraded
to
river
view
for
but
chose
not
to
we
enjoyed
the
room
for
what
it
was
floor
looking
south
the
buffet
breakfast
was
great
lots
to
choose
from
and
very
fresh
with
made
to
order
eggs
non
stop
coffee
and
juice
and
the
servers
were
so
eager
to
please
great
to
have
breakfast
included
in
night
stay
might
be
a
bit
dear
to
pay
at
it
was
nice
to
sit
and
relax
with
good
breakfast
coffee
and
newspaper
and
not
have
to
figure
where
to
catch
a
morning
meal
concierge
desk
was
most
helpful
in
suggesting
places
to
eat
always
informative
and
ready
to
provide
maps
directions
multiple
suggestions
and
even
make
the
reservations
cards
included
to
admit
without
paying
cover
charges
at
some
jazz
clubs
location
was
great
blocks
from
el
and
other
transportation
and
easy
walking
distance
to
the
parks
and
right
on
the
river
if
in
chicago
again
would
not
hesitate
to
stay
here
again
a
swimming
pool
would
have
been
nice
but
we
did
not
miss
it

my
wife
and
i
came
to
spend
the
weekend
in
downtown
chicago
for
shopping
and
we
found
this
conrad
hotel
well
located
close
to
everything
downtown
and
of
a
size
that
doesngt
make
you
feel
lost
in
the
convention
world
we
have
had
this
feeling
when
staying
at
larger
hotels
in
the
past
our
suite
has
view
on
michigan
avenue
with
a
bit
of
the
lake
at
the
end
staff
was
very
professional
pleasant
and
friendly
making
us
feel
very
comfortable
internet
is
free
n
the
rooms
and
i
am
making
my
review
from
there

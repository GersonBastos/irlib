we
booked
our
room
on
priceline
and
got
a
good
deal
at
around
per
night
we
stayed
for
the
first
nights
of
our
us
trip
so
didnt
use
too
many
of
the
hotelgs
facilities
the
hotel
is
centrally
located
just
over
the
chicago
river
from
the
shops
at
north
michigan
avenue
and
around
a
mile
from
navy
pier
our
room
was
clean
and
comfortable
and
on
the
floor
we
had
a
good
view
of
the
city
and
could
just
about
see
lake
michigan
though
the
weather
was
very
bad
the
layout
of
the
room
is
a
little
peculiar
with
the
bed
facing
away
from
the
window
but
over
all
we
have
no
complaints
about
this
hotel
and
unlike
some
other
reviews
we
were
not
disturbed
at
all
by
noise
from
other
guests
so
pros
and
consg

and
friendly

quite
simply
the
hyatt
regency
chicago
is
the
business
travelergs
best
friend
recently
i
had
to
attend
a
seminar
in
chicago
and
stayed
at
the
hyatt
to
say
i
was
impressed
would
be
an
understatement
centrally
located
in
the
heart
of
downtown
the
hyatt
has
perfected
the
art
of
ultimate
guest
satisfaction
on
arrival
the
staff
goes
into
overdrive
they
make
you
feel
like
you
are
the
only
guest
in
this
huge
hotel
the
rooms
are
very
big
and
elegantly
furnished
with
percent
cotton
linens
my
room
came
equipped
with
flat
screen
tv
wi
fi
and
high
speed
internet
room
service
was
quite
extensive
and
if
it
was
not
on
the
menu
they
went
out
of
their
way
to
accomodate
you
there
were
also
car
rental
on
site
as
were
restaurants
cocktail
bar
and
a
hour
dining
room
they
have
state
of
the
art
conference
rooms
with
high
tech
features
there
is
also
catering
and
limo
service
the
staff
is
multilingual
and
the
concierge
service
is
very
professional
all
in
all
they
will
pamper
you
from
head
to
toe
and
other
parts
in
between
this
hotel
is
definitely
worth
the
price
and
i
will
definitely
return
not
as
a
business
traveler
but
as
a
tourist
who
wants
to
be
pampered
my
only
regret
that
i
could
not
stay
much
longer

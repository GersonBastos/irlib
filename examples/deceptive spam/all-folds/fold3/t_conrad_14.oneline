my
husband
and
i
decided
to
take
a
trip
to
chicago
at
the
last
minute
and
quickly
chose
the
conrad
not
really
knowing
itgs
location
we
were
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
it
was
almost
right
on
michigan
ave
itgs
connect
to
nordstroms
right
in
the
heart
of
downtown
great
for
shopping
the
hotel
itself
was
fabulous
the
staff
was
extremely
helpful
in
giving
suggestions
for
shows
and
restaurants
i
recommend
going
to
joegs
thatgs
right
across
the
street
from
the
hotel
everyone
was
raving
about
it
but
we
couldngt
get
a
reservation
the
room
was
wonderful
and
the
bed
and
pillows
were
very
comfortable
it
had
a
very
warm
and
inviting
atmosphere
my
husband
loved
the
workout
room
i
highly
recommend
the
conrad

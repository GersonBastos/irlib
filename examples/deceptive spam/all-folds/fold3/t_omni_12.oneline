my
husband
and
i
had
a
wonderful
stay
at
the
omni
chicago
hotel
i
had
contacted
the
customer
service
representative
prior
to
our
stay
to
request
a
quiet
suite
when
we
arrived
she
greeted
us
and
confirmed
that
we
were
getting
exactly
what
i
had
requested
and
more
our
suite
had
a
partial
view
of
the
lake
and
we
were
able
to
check
in
early
the
service
at
this
hotel
is
incredible
everyone
made
us
feel
welcome
and
took
care
to
respond
to
any
question
or
request
that
we
had
the
suite
was
very
quiet
even
though
we
were
on
the
east
side
of
the
hotel
very
near
to
michigan
avenue
housekeeping
was
prompt
and
thorough
we
really
couldngt
have
asked
for
a
better
hotel
we
will
definitely
stay
there
on
future
trips
to
chicago
and
will
recommend
this
hotel
to
anyone
who
travels
there

the
omni

they
were
right
on
the
location

etc
were
all
wonderful
huge
thank
you
to
ta

program

did
that
before
we
left
and
received
complimentary
beverages
in
the
morning
and
newspapers
among
other
perks
i
loved
being
woken
up
to
fresh
orange
juice
and
the
chicago
tribune
newspaper

were
in

was
perfect
corner

two
out
of
the

a
gorgeous
king
bed

bathroom
amenities
were
wonderful
i
loved
soaking
in
the
tub
with
the
mineral
salts
that
were
provided
the
turn
down
service
was
great
as
well
we
would
come
back
to
our
room
with
relaxing
music
playing
and
our
bed
ready
for
us
we
ate
at
their
restaurant
twice

always
smiling

we
wanted
to
do

also
used
the
gym
during
my
stay
and
it
was
great

the
machines
were
top

a
lcd

had
two
plasmas
they

had
cold
lemon
water
for
you
after

i
am
a
stickler
for
cleanliness

sparkling
every
morning

really
was
a
fantastic
stay
at
the
omni

we
would
never
stay
anywhere
else
i
also
wanted
to
mention
we
never
heard
any
construction
while
we
were
there
everything
was
quiet

slept
wonderfully
on
the
big
comfy
bed
thank

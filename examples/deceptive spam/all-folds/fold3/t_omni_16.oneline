igll
keep
it
short
my
wife
daughter
and
i
stayed
at
this
hotel
for
nights
we
go
on
several
vacations
a
year
and
this
was
a
great
hotel
locationg
it
is
located
in
the
center
of
the
magnificent
mile
michigan
ave
so
it
is
near
or
easily
accessible
to
everything
you
might
want
to
do
hotelg
the
hotel
itself
is
very
clean
as
were
the
rooms
maid
service
was
excellent
including
daily
cleaning
and
turndown
service
i
think
they
missed
a
night
serviceg
every
staff
member
we
encountered
was
super
friendly
and
kind
they
always
have
someone
at
the
lobby
door
greeting
you
with
a
smile
every
night
we
had
milk
and
cookies
waiting
in
our
room
sometimes
chocolates
on
our
pillows
they
always
pushed
the
elevator
button
for
you
if
they
were
near
it
there
was
no
shortage
of
people
to
ask
things
my
only
conplaint
was
that
the
congierge
was
tough
to
get
they
shouuld
have
more
than
one
or
longer
hours
otherg
we
had
breakfast
in
the
restaurant
and
it
was
very
good
and
well
attended
appointed
they
even
carried
my
wifes
plate
to
the
table
from
the
buffet
the
pool
was
a
nice
addition
and
a
hit
with
the
kids
it
was
nice
to
go
for
a
swim
after
a
long
day
of
walking
pool
and
changing
areas
were
spotless
roomg
clean
sunny
and
spacious
probably
over
sq
ft
tvs
couch
desk
chairs
all
in
perfect
shape
the
windows
open
for
some
fresh
air
pillows
were
pretty
comfortable
with
all
aspects
considered
i
think
this
was
an
unbeatable
value
i
would
not
hesitate
to
stay
again
or
recommend
it
to
a
friend
i
truly
have
nothing
negative
to
say
about
the
hotel
it
was
a
wonderful
stay
and
we
will
miss
being
there
omni
has
hit
the
right
formula
to
make
a
guest
feel
like
a
welcomed
person
as
opposed
to
just
a
nuisance
or
a
number
the
airlines
have
cornered
the
market
on
that

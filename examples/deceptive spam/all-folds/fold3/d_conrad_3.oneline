my
wife
and
i
checked
in
to
this
hotel
after
a
rough
flight
from
los
angeles
we
decided
to
treat
ourselves
to
a
nice
hotel
while
visiting
our
recently
graduated
son
and
we
were
not
disappointed
the
location
could
not
have
been
better
as
we
were
afforded
easy
access
to
chicagogs
culture
and
shopping
by
being
just
off
michigan
avenue
after
a
long
day
of
exploring
the
city
we
enjoyed
a
fantastic
dinner
on
the
terrace
overlooking
the
city
the
halibut
was
cooked
just
right
and
our
waiter
made
us
feel
very
welcome
with
some
friendly
conversation
overall
i
would
recommend
this
hotel
to
anyone
traveling
in
chicago

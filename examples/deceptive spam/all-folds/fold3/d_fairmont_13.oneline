when
my
new
fiance
told
me
about
his
business
trip
to
chicago
i
was
quite
annoyed
mostly
because
he
insisted
i
come
along
he
made
up
for
me
so
not
wanting
to
come
along
and
be
alone
all
weekend
with
this
wonderful
hotel
his
mother
told
him
all
about
this
hotel
when
she
and
her
husband
stayed
here
in
the
summer
of
she
loved
it
and
so
did
i
i
was
so
bummed
about
being
all
alone
for
most
of
the
weekend
but
the
decor
wonderful
staff
and
massages
made
up
for
it
i
spent
my
time
in
the
spa
and
the
asian
restaurant
and
couldngt
have
asked
for
a
better
experience
i
am
definately
coming
along
on
the
next
business
trip

the
hyatt
regency
chicago
hotel
is
perfecty
located
in
the
center
of
downtown
chicago
whether
you
are
going
there
for
business
or
pleasure
it
is
in
the
perfect
place
the
rooms
are
large
and
beautiful
and
the
ball
room
took
my
breath
away
the
wi
fi
connection
was
perfect
for
the
work
i
needed
to
do
and
the
show
at
the
navy
pier
was
perfect
for
when
i
needed
a
break
other
hotels
have
nothing
on
the
hyatt
i
just
wish
there
was
a
hyatt
regency
in
every
city
for
all
of
my
business
trips

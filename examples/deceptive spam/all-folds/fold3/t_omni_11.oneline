i
stayed
at
the
omni
for
one
night
following
a
business
meeting
at
another
downtown
chicago
hotel
i
was
completely
impressed
by
the
serviceg
all
personnel
during
my
stay
were
absolutely
outstanding
i
checked
in
quite
early
no
problem
and
was
efficiently
checked
in
my
room
had
a
somewhat
heavy
scent
of
air
freshener
the
only
negative
from
the
entire
stay
which
was
managed
reasonably
well
by
opening
the
windows
i
dongt
generally
require
much
during
my
hotel
stays
but
suffice
to
say
the
doorman
housekeeping
the
night
manager
and
bartender
at
the
day
waiter
at
and
the
concierge
were
amazing
i
never
waited
more
than
about
seconds
for
anything
the
room
was
very
comfy
and
the
amenities
were
superior
one
very
tiny
complaint
there
was
no
wastebasket
near
the
sink
or
near
the
wet
bar
had
to
walk
to
the
other
end
of
the
bathroom
or
sitting
room
to
dispose
of
kleenex
coffee
paraphernalia
one
wastebasket
would
make
all
the
difference
all
that
said
what
a
great
hotel
thanks
omni
i
had
a
great
stay

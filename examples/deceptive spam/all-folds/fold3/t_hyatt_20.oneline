this
comes
a
little
late
as
igm
finally
catching
up
on
my
reviews
from
the
past
several
monthsg
a
dear
friend
and
i
stayed
at
the
hyatt
regency
in
late
october
for
one
night
while
visiting
a
friend
and
her
husband
from
out
of
town
this
hotel
is
perfect
imo
easy
check
in
and
check
out
lovely
clean
comfortable
rooms
with
great
views
of
the
city
i
know
this
area
pretty
well
and
itgs
very
convenient
to
many
downtown
chicago
attractions
we
had
dinner
and
went
clubing
with
our
friends
around
division
st
we
had
no
problems
getting
cabs
back
and
forth
to
the
hyatt
and
theregs
even
public
transportation
right
near
by
but
we
didngt
bother
since
we
only
needed
cabs
from
and
to
the
hotel
parking
as
is
usual
for
chicago
was
expensive
but
we
were
able
to
get
our
car
out
quickly
however
we
left
on
a
sunday
morning
not
exactly
a
high
traffic
time
although
it
was
a
bears
homegame
day
so
a
bit
busier
than
usual
i
would
think
no
problems
at
all
and
the
best
part
is
that
we
got
a
rate
of
through
hotwire
a
downright
steal
for
this
area
of
chicago
and
the
quality
of
the
hotel

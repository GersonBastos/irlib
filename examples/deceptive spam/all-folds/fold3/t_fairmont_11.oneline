the
reviews
we
read
were
a
bit
mixed
but
i
thought
it
was
excellent
igve
stayed
in
the
splendido
villa
dgeste
and
others
and
it
doesngt
compare
but
nor
should
it
it
doesngt
claim
to
be
in
that
space
i
expected
it
to
be
a
notch
off
the
four
seasons
and
so
it
proved
a
only
a
small
notch
too
lovely
clean
and
bright
room
superb
views
very
quiet
comfy
bed
etc
excellent
service
all
round
and
nice
staff
for
the
money
and
quality
it
stacked
up
very
well
indeed
couldngt
really
fault
it
any
way
given
it
was
half
the
cost
of
the
four
seasons
but
pretty
close
in
terms
of
overall
experience
we
will
go
there
again
when
in
chicago
great
location
too

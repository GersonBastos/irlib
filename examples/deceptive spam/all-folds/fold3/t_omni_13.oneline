we
stayed
at
omni
chicago
for
nights
in
early
july
july
the
reason
we
chose
this
hotel
was
simply
because
of
a
great
deal
we
got
on
travelzoo
we
got
pretty
good
rate
that
included
a
valet
parking
and
vouchers
for
i
also
signed
up
for
their
loyalty
program
which
was
so
worth
it
i
was
concerned
at
first
that
we
would
be
treated
like
a
second
class
guest
because
of
the
price
we
paid
but
i
was
totally
wrong
they
treated
us
extremely
well
before
our
arrival
i
got
an
email
asking
if
we
needed
anything
so
i
asked
for
a
fridge
to
store
the
baby
milk
and
they
arranged
it
for
us
without
charge
g
we
arrived
late
on
thursday
night
our
room
was
ready
for
us
upon
our
arrival
with
the
fridge
i
requested
we
were
given
a
corner
suite
on
the
floor
very
nice
room
comfy
bed
my
husband
was
really
wowwwww
the
bed
was
made
ready
for
us
both
in
the
bedroom
and
the
sofa
bed
we
didngt
use
the
sofa
bed
though
we
got
a
high
speed
internet
as
part
of
the
loyalty
program
all
staff
were
friendly
and
helpful
front
desk
valet
parking
bell
boy
room
service
concierge
everyone
we
used
the
voucher
for
room
service
breakfasts
both
morning
the
first
day
was
great
food
was
great
and
quick
we
also
got
complimentary
beverages
as
part
of
the
loyalty
program
we
ordered
oj
and
hot
chocolate
they
both
were
so
good
that
we
ordered
them
again
the
next
morning
but
we
were
very
disappointed
that
the
hot
chocolate
tasted
pretty
horrible
it
tasted
like
left
over
coffee
mixed
with
water
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
g
also
we
ordered
belgian
waffle
for
our
breakfast
which
was
supposed
to
come
with
whipped
cream
and
strawberries
but
we
got
a
plain
waffle
so
we
had
to
call
the
restaurant
and
wait
for
a
while
to
get
those
this
is
why
i
didngt
give
for
service
however
i
reported
these
issues
to
the
front
desk
when
checking
out
and
the
front
desk
staff
took
care
of
it
by
not
charging
us
for
that
meal
another
thing
is
that
itgs
quite
noisy
at
night
even
though
we
were
on
the
high
floor
we
could
hear
siren
going
on
off
during
the
night
but
this
is
out
of
the
hotelgs
control
though
and
i
would
say
that
it
didngt
bother
us
at
all
my
baby
could
sleep
very
well
overall
we
really
enjoyed
our
stay
and
would
definitely
consider
omni
for
our
next
trip
to
chicago

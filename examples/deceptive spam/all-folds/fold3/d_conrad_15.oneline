this
hotel
is
absolutely
amazing
i
have
paid
to
stay
in
hotels
that
cost
an
arm
and
a
leg
only
to
get
crappy
service
in
return
however
here
itgs
comfortable
friendly
and
a
vacation
in
fact
all
vacations
start
with
your
lodging
and
how
can
you
have
a
good
vacation
with
poor
lodging
the
beds
are
comfortable
clean
and
upscale
while
still
being
homey
enough
to
be
relaxed
the
services
and
staff
are
tops
and
the
view
from
the
rooms
is
absolutely
gorgeous
and
i
must
commend
the
cleanliness
nice
place
to
stay
and
worth
every
penny
will
definitely
be
coming
back

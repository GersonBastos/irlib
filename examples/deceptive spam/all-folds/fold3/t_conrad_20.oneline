my
boyfriend
and
i
decided
to
stay
at
the
conrad
chicago
for
our
anniversary
the
second
we
walked
in
we
were
immediately
won
over
by
the
look
and
feel
of
the
room
white
luxurous
bedding
on
the
king
bed
plasma
t
v
subroofer
surround
sound
speakers
my
boyfriend
was
more
impressed
than
me
as
i
reminded
him
that
we
didngt
come
to
chicago
for
the
hotel
room
very
large
bathroom
w
tub
and
separate
stand
in
shower
granite
countertops
his
her
robes
and
slippers
the
view
wasngt
great
but
we
were
on
the
floor
and
not
really
high
enough
to
see
anything
but
the
side
of
the
building
next
to
us
not
a
large
room
by
any
means
but
again
we
didngt
go
to
the
city
for
the
hotel
room
it
was
the
prefect
size
for
the
amount
of
time
we
were
actually
in
the
room
we
got
a
great
rate
on
it
at
hotels
com
but
i
think
the
going
rate
is
usually
closer
to
mid
igve
stayed
in
quite
a
few
hotels
in
the
downtown
area
and
none
have
ever
impressed
me
more
than
this
one
we
will
definitely
be
staying
there
again
on
our
next
trip
into
the
city

the
conrad
chicago
was
by
far
the
best
experience
i
have
ever
had
in
travel
leisure
not
only
was
the
room
beautifully
decorated
and
very
comfortable
but
the
food
in
the
restaurant
was
exquisite
not
to
mention
the
perfect
service
from
the
resortgs
employees
i
was
very
impressed
by
how
quick
and
caring
the
staff
was
of
my
own
personal
needs
igm
naturally
a
fitness
freak
so
i
was
pleased
to
learn
of
their
massive
fitness
area
on
the
floor
best
of
all
it
was
available
to
guests
at
any
time
day
or
night
the
resort
was
conveniently
located
by
a
large
shopping
area
so
it
wasngt
a
far
walk
to
scope
out
the
shops
the
most
memorable
part
of
my
stay
was
looking
out
at
the
city
after
dark
and
seeing
how
gorgeous
chicago
looks
all
lit
up
it
was
so
relaxing
just
watching
the
city
come
to
life
i
was
very
disappointed
when
i
had
to
pack
and
leave
any
time
that
i
make
my
way
back
to
chicago
you
better
believe
i
will
be
staying
at
the
conrad
chicago
i
recommend
this
resort
to
everyone
i
know
who
does
a
lot
of
traveling

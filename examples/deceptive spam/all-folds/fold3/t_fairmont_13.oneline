for
the
price
of
the
marriott
we
spent
a
night
here
tax
and
had
an
enjoyable
if
brief
stay
as
others
have
noted
the
hotel
has
been
recently
renovated
and
the
rooms
are
furnished
with
attractive
and
sleek
scandanavian
type
design
the
staff
was
polite
and
attentive
and
seemed
to
match
the
redesign
with
a
hip
kind
of
feel
the
parking
is
pricey
at
so
i
used
an
adjacent
lot
and
self
parked
and
as
others
have
noted
the
lack
of
water
pressue
in
the
shower
was
disappointing
good
location
would
return
esp
as
this
pricepoint

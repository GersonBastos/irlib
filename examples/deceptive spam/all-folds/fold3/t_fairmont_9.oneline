stayed
at
the
fairmont
for
a
few
nights
and
found
the
whole
experience
excellent
i
was
given
a
very
large
room
with
great
views
of
the
cityg
the
breakfast
was
extremely
goodg
and
the
location
was
as
central
as
i
could
have
wished
for
the
pool
was
not
large
but
felt
luxurious
and
was
great
for
early
morning
swims
in
the
evening
i
spent
some
time
in
the
hotel
bar
with
friends
and
that
was
excellent

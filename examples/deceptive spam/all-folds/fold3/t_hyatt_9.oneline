i
stayed
at
the
hyatt
for
a
two
nights
on
a
business
trip
my
room
was
oddly
shaped
to
give
a
stunning
view
of
the
river
and
nbc
building
both
the
room
and
the
bathroom
were
spotless
and
the
room
had
an
air
purifier
which
ran
silently
the
hotel
was
well
staffed
with
individuals
who
were
knowledgeable
about
both
the
hotel
and
the
surrounding
area
i
would
not
hesitate
to
stay
here
again
and
plan
to
return
with
my
wife
for
a
weekend

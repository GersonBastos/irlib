we
chose
to
stay
at
the
hilton
chicago
because
it
was
in
such
a
centralized
location
everything
that
our
family
wanted
to
do
in
town
was
located
so
close
what
i
didngt
expect
was
for
the
beds
to
be
so
comfortable
i
cangt
remember
when
i
got
a
better
nightgs
sleep
the
staff
was
very
friendly
and
the
hotel
grounds
were
impeccably
kept
wegll
be
returning
to
the
hilton
chicago
the
next
time
wegre
in
town

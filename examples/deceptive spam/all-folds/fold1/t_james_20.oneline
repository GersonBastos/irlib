i
loved
this
hotel
the
room
was
so
chic
and
trendy
the
bed
was
comfortable
great
slippers
and
robes
i
love
the
keihlgs
bath
products
in
the
bathroom
we
went
during
my
birthday
weekend
and
they
had
a
card
and
plate
with
pastries
waiting
in
the
room
we
got
a
great
deal
on
a
junior
suite
from
travelzoo
but
when
we
tried
to
take
another
trip
to
chicago
the
deal
was
gone
i
really
recommend
the
hotel
i
loved
it
the
only
problem
we
had
was
with
the
david
burke
steakhouse
the
service
was
horrible
they
switched
our
order
with
the
table
next
to
ourgs
and
the
only
compensation
was
they
took
off
a
side
dish
we
ordered
and
they
were
nice
enough
to
not
charge
us
for
the
other
side
dish
we
didngt
get
dongt
go
there
go
to
the
lawrygs
accross
the
street
but
stay
at
the
james
btw
its
not
a
star
hotel
like
the
website
lists
its
at
least
star

we
just
got
back
from
nights
at
the
sofitel
we
really
have
nothing
bad
or
negative
to
say
about
it
wegve
stayed
at
other
higher
end
hotels
in
chicago
such
as
the
park
hyatt
the
peninsula
and
the
four
seasons
and
the
sofitel
tops
them
all
itgs
a
star
hotel
with
star
prices
itgs
a
beautiful
hotel
all
the
way
around
staff
is
uniformly
friendly
without
being
patronizing
they
were
helpful
with
the
one
small
problem
we
had
and
solved
it
quickly
the
common
areas
are
fresh
and
modern
in
appearance
the
room
was
very
clean
with
comfortable
beds
and
well
appointed
marble
accented
baths
my
wife
loved
the
huge
tub
we
had
breakfast
via
roomservice
every
morning
and
it
was
always
hot
and
delicious
the
robes
and
evian
at
turndown
was
always
appreciated
the
property
is
ideally
situated
in
the
middle
of
the
gold
coast
and
all
the
best
shopping
and
eating
is
within
a
short
walk

a
bentley
or

we
loved
this
hotel
and
would
definitely
come
back
initially
we
werengt
given
a
goldfish
which
was
disappointing
but
then
we
left
a
tip
for
the
housekeeper
and
she
rewarded
us
with
one
we
had
fun
sipping
wine
and
playing
wii
in
the
lobby
every
afternoon
the
staff
were
quite
friendly
and
helpful
even
printing
our
boarding
passes
for
us
our
room
was
very
comfortable
with
a
cozy
little
alcove
at
the
window
where
we
read
the
paper
at
first
we
were
worried
about
noise
since
our
room
was
next
to
the
elevator
but
we
hardly
heard
it
and
didngt
notice
any
street
noise
either
the
hotel
is
colorfully
and
tastefully
decorated
well
lit
and
ideally
located

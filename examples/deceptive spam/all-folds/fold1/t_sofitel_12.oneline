i
read
the
reviews
on
trip
advisor
for
this
property
which
had
it
ranked
as
in
chicago
i
got
a
king
room
overlooking
michigan
ave
the
view
was
beautiful
the
room
was
also
impeccable
nice
and
bright
very
fresh
and
modern
i
find
it
very
hard
to
fault
any
sofitelgs
the
service
attentiveness
of
staff
cleanliness
and
luxury
are
always
top
notch
location
was
great
head
left
from
the
lobby
and
you
reach
a
bunch
of
european
style
cafegs
and
restaurants
straight
ahead
of
the
hotel
on
michigan
ave
is
a
shoppers
paradise
a
great
place
to
stay
and
much
better
value
than
park
hyatt
i
do
find
some
of
the
charges
in
luxury
hotels
to
be
a
bit
crazy
such
as
for
the
internet
when
you
are
paying
top
dollar
a
few
inclusions
would
be
nice

the
hilton
hotel
helped
us
make
the
most
of
our
trip
to
chicago
not
only
are
they
centrally
located
near
most
of
chi
towns
hot
spots
but
they
also
helped
coordinate
discounted
admissions
to
various
other
attractions
the
hilton
is
very
classy
with
their
accommodations
i
will
be
returning
at
my
earliest
convenience
be
it
for
business
or
pleasure

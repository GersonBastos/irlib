we
had
a
great
experience
at
this
hotel
the
hotel
is
huge
the
rooms
were
very
clean
well
appointed
and
our
room
was
very
roomy
with
a
great
view
of
the
snow
covered
park
the
staff
was
so
nice
and
very
helpfull
donald
at
the
the
concierge
desk
scored
us
tickets
to
wicked
the
day
of
the
performance
and
on
a
holiday
weekend
too
they
were
great
seats
and
a
reasonable
price
he
worked
very
hard
for
us
to
see
that
show
they
truely
topped
off
what
was
a
fun
new
years
celebration
this
will
be
my
first
pick
when
i
return
in
the
spring

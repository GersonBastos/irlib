mostly
great
with
a
few
islands
of
relatively
minor
problems
first
the
goodg
outside
of
the
hotel
and
lobby
were
decorated
like
a
winter
wonderland
as
befitted
the
season
the
restaurant
service
was
absolutely
flawless
servers
who
dongt
write
orders
because
they
are
expected
to
remember
them
remember
clients
clearly
from
one
day
to
the
other
and
go
above
and
beyond
consistently
rooms
are
comfortableg
yes
the
beds
are
great
the
gym
is
well
equipped
second
the
slightly
off
puttingg
mmmhh
we
got
the
i
love
chocolate
package
which
advertizedg
bfast
every
day
dinner
once
snack
once
and
a
gift
and
we
have
an
a
club
favorite
guest
membership
which
also
advertized
a
gift
so
no
gift
either
for
the
chocolate
package
or
the
favorite
guest
membership
upon
enquiry
the
snack
was
the
gift
not
at
all
what
the
package
suggested
that
said
bfast
was
sublime
and
the
chocolate
dinner
outstanding
as
well
some
problems
at
checkout
thoughg
we
got
charged
for
all
dining
despite
having
booked
the
package
and
it
took
quite
a
while
for
a
polite
but
seemingly
less
than
informed
front
desk
staff
to
correct
the
problem
would
absolutely
go
back
but
probably
not
on
a
special
package

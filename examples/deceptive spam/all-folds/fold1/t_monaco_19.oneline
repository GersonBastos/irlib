stayed
here
with
friends
for
a
long
weekend
in
august
and
loved
the
hotel
enjoyed
the
free
nightly
wine
happy
hour
and
the
accomodations
were
quite
nice
our
beds
were
very
soft
and
comfortable
we
had
excellent
views
of
the
river
from
our
rooms
the
location
was
wonderful
for
seeing
the
sights
around
town
with
easy
access
to
public
transportation
nearby
my
friends
actually
received
the
goldfish
upon
request
which
they
enjoyed
some
noise
could
be
heard
from
rooms
nearby
or
above
but
it
was
minimal
price
seemed
very
resonable
to
us
for
the
location
will
certainly
return
to
the
windy
city
and
plan
on
staying
here
again

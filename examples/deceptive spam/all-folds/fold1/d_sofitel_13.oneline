i
stayed
in
the
sofitel
chicago
water
tower
hotel
with
my
husband
and
two
kids
last
weekend
and
will
definitely
use
this
hotel
again
for
future
travels
the
spacious
rooms
with
modern
innovative
furniture
and
comfortable
beds
was
a
great
contrast
to
the
small
dismal
rooms
and
rock
hard
beds
that
i
have
found
at
other
hotel
chains
the
bathrooms
were
neat
tidy
and
well
stocked
with
towels
and
personal
needs
such
as
toilet
paper
shampoo
and
soap
the
carpet
was
clean
not
stained
and
dingy
like
some
hotels
the
room
decor
was
astounding
and
the
view
from
our
window
was
wonderful
i
enjoyed
every
aspect
of
this
hotel
stay
from
the
courteous
staff
at
check
in
to
the
ease
of
requesting
room
service
and
checking
out
thanks
for
making
me
feel
right
at
home

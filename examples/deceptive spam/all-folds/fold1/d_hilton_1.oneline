my
husband
and
i
satayed
for
two
nights
at
the
hilton
chicago
and
enjoyed
every
minute
of
it
the
bedrooms
are
immaculate
and
the
linnens
are
very
soft
we
also
appreciated
the
free
wifi
as
we
could
stay
in
touch
with
friends
while
staying
in
chicago
the
bathroom
was
quite
spacious
and
i
loved
the
smell
of
the
shampoo
they
provided
not
like
most
hotel
shampoos
their
service
was
amazing
and
we
absolutely
loved
the
beautiful
indoor
pool
i
would
recommend
staying
here
to
anyone

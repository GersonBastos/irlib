our
room
was
on
the
third
floor
so
there
was
some
street
noise
but
it
certainly
didngt
spoil
our
nights
in
this
lovely
hotel
wine
tasting
evening
went
down
extremely
well
after
a
day
seeing
the
sights
of
the
city
our
goldish
was
called
oliver
nobody
could
believe
we
had
our
very
own
goldfish
in
our
room
all
the
staff
were
really
helpful
and
welcoming
making
our
stay
here
very
relaxing
and
comfortable
would
certainly
recommend
this
hotel

igve
stayed
at
several
different
hotels
in
chicago
but
the
james
is
the
best
everything
i
need
is
in
walking
distance
and
i
find
it
very
convenient
to
stay
there
the
staff
at
the
concierge
desk
is
so
polite
and
offers
assistance
willingly
the
room
has
always
been
very
clean
the
bed
linens
are
better
that
the
nice
sheets
i
have
on
my
own
bed
thankfully
i
dongt
have
to
search
around
for
somewhere
to
stay
when
i
travel
there
as
igve
found
my
favorite

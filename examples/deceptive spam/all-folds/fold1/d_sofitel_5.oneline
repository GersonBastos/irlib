i
would
like
to
add
a
comment
maybe
this
will
help
others
when
choosing
for
a
wedding
destination
my
daughter
was
married
in
may
of
and
we
decided
to
have
the
special
event
at
the
sofitel
water
towerg
we
were
amazed
she
always
wanted
a
ballroom
type
of
wedding
and
sofitel
made
this
happen
for
her
they
took
care
of
all
the
invitations
cake
decor
and
so
much
more
the
special
day
for
my
daughter
was
worth
everything

you
are
going
to
be

the
chicago
area

this
will
be
the
only
hotel
i
will
never
forget
in
my
life
hotel
monaco
chicago
has
the
best
staff
and
also
the
rooms
are
also
nice
whether
if
itgs
a
king
delux
room
or
a
tranquility
suite
all
of
the
rooms
are
luxorious
and
are
themed
based
so
it
suits
ones
personality
even
if
you
are
a
super
sized
person
like
me
with
a
height
of
there
are
special
tall
rooms
just
for
you
my
days
went
very
fast
when
i
stayed
there
becuase
there
was
so
much
to
do
there
in
the
mornings
i
would
do
yoga
from
the
yoga
channel
then
i
would
go
downstairs
and
drink
one
of
their
complimentary
coffees
while
reading
the
morning
newspaper
before
i
go
to
a
meeting
i
would
get
my
shoes
shined
by
their
complimentary
shoeshine
service
after
i
come
back
from
the
meeting
i
would
go
to
their
fitness
rooms
and
workout
on
their
fully
equipped
machines
i
just
didngt
want
to
leave
that
hotelg
so
i
decided
that
the
next
time
i
come
to
chicago
i
will
surely
stay
at
hotel
monaco
chicago

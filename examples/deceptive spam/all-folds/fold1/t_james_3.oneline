the
james
hotel
met
and
exceeded
our
expectations
a
haven
of
cool
uncluttered
comfort
in
a
hot
crowded
but
congenial
city
located
within
steps
of
some
of
the
greatest
art
architecture
culinary
and
cultural
opportunities
anywhere
in
north
america
the
staff
of
the
james

us
with
a
home
away
from
home
for
the
week
we
visited
the
check
in
was
quick
and
flawless
and
the
king
suite
a
calm
restorative
oasis

is
difficult
to
over
praise
the
friendly
attentive

this
is
a
hotel
that
truly
has
its
act
together
the
day
before

experienced
problems
with
the
roomgs
air
conditioner
when
the
technician
was
unable
to
quickly
solve
the
problem

were
immediately

i
took
the
wife
and
kids
to
chicago
for
one
last
fling
before
school
started
back
up
when
i
checked
in
the
staff
was
very
attentive
i
showed
a
little
consideration
for
the
friendly
attitude
small
tip
and
was
upgraded
to
a
huge
upper
floor
room
complete
with
a
bar
i
didngt
get
the
priceline
glare
and
it
paid
off
for
all
involved
the
air
and
water
show
was
underway
on
the
lake
front
and
we
had
planes
flying
over
our
room
the
kids
thought
it
was
great
that
night
we
had
a
great
view
of
the
fireworks
at
navy
pier
the
sunday
morning
breakfast
buffet
at
the
hotel
was
very
good
and
the
price
was
not
out
of
reason
the
conceirge
was
very
knowledgeable
and
very
friendly
it
was
one
of
the
best
times
we
ever
had
in
chicago

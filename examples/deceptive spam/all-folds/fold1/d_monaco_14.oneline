i
have
heard
friends
talking
about
the
hotel
monaco
in
chicago
and
did
have
my
doubts
at
first
however
when
i
arrived
there
was
amazed
at
the
location
it
is
near
so
many
shopping
places
museums
theatre
and
many
others
places
was
in
town
for
visiting
old
family
and
friends
so
did
not
plan
to
stay
in
room
for
long
however
the
room
was
still
amazingly
clean
and
well
kept
entire
day
stay
fell
asleep
quick
in
the
beds
and
woke
up
ready
for
another
day
the
staff
at
the
place
is
amazing
i
even
got
very
good
directions
from
them
as
sadly
didnt
know
the
area
too
well
and
had
plans
to
meet
people
one
day
did
spend
the
day
in
room
recovering
from
a
long
night
and
the
room
service
was
the
best
i
have
ever
had
at
a
hotel
all
and
all
was
highly
impressed
of
this
hotel
good
room
good
service
and
was
able
to
have
great
time
with
friends
and
family
by
bringing
them
there
and
places
nearby
will
be
heading
back
to
this
hotel
many
times

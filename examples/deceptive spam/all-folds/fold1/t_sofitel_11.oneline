stayed
at
the
sofitel
chicago
water
tower
for
nights
in
early
april
very
convenient
location
just
a
block
from
all
of
the
shopping
on
the
golden
mile
good
restaurant
at
the
hotel
serving
a
la
carte
breakfast
different
from
the
usual
fare
and
with
a
nice
french
twist
dinner
at
the
restaurant
was
also
good
prices
are
reasonable
room
is
comfortable
only
problem
was
with
a
card
access
door
lock
that
usually
required
several
swipes
before
opening
excellent
service
from
the
bellmen
to
the
concierge
and
front
desk
staff
would
definitely
stay
here
again
if
visiting
chicago
concierge
recommended
a
small
van
tour
which
was
excellent
however
early
april
is
too
early
to
visit
chicago
as
popular
activities
such
as
the
boat
tour
of
the
architecture
of
chicago
was
not
operating
yet

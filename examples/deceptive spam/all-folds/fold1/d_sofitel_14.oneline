i
recently
traveled
up
to
chicago
for
business
and
had
a
terrific
day
night
stay
at
the
sofitel
chicago
water
tower
in
downtown
the
location
was
perfect
as
it
gave
me
easy
access
to
michigan
avenue
and
the
conference
center
where
i
was
doing
business
my
hotel
room
was
rather
nice
with
a
very
comfortable
king
size
bed
and
a
cozy
atmosphere
i
ordered
room
service
for
dinner
and
it
came
within
minutes
so
i
was
quite
pleased
with
that
and
they
serve
from
their
own
restaurant
which
is
located
downstairs
the
food
was
extremely
good
and
i
really
enjoyed
not
having
to
go
out
and
fight
the
traffic
to
find
a
good
place
to
eat
i
had
been
really
tired
from
my
meeting
earlier
in
the
day
and
had
no
trouble
going
to
bed
on
the
comfortable
mattress
i
woke
up
and
took
a
shower
and
the
bathroom
was
definitely
up
to
standard
with
any
other
quality
hotel
they
had
all
the
soaps
and
stuff
as
usual
and
they
had
plenty
of
towels
on
hand
as
well
after
shower
i
headed
down
and
they
had
a
breakfast
buffet
at
the
restaurant
which
was
free
for
hotel
guests
the
breakfast
was
delicious
and
started
my
day
out
right
after
my
business
stuff
was
over
i
really
got
out
and
enjoyed
chicago
i
met
up
with
a
friend
who
came
over
and
visited
my
hotel
and
she
was
quite
impressed
with
it
as
well
when
i
go
back
to
chicago
i
will
definitely
stay
at
the
sofitel
again

after
reading
the
reviews
on
this
hotel
i
decided
to
book
my
stay
for
july
weekend
here
and
i
am
glad
i
did
this
hotel
is
absolutely
beautiful
our
suite
was
gorgeous
it
is
a
very
romantic
hotel
with
big
sit
in
picture
windows
i
do
have
complaint
the
bar
is
very
boring
and
the
resturant
is
not
that
great
but
other
than
that
i
loved
it
i
would
definitely
stay
there
again

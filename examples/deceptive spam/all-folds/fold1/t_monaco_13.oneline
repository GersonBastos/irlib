my
initial
thought
of
the
hotel
was
this
place
is
just
ok
i
didnt
look
up
any
reviews
as
i
was
staying
there
with
other
friends
i
was
truly
impressed
from
ceiling
to
floor
with
the
room
views
were
good
its
just
the
surrounding
buildings
unless
your
towards
the
front
where
the
river
is
located
igm
crazy
about
huge
bathrooms
and
this
one
is
huge
i
love
all
the
space
they
have
flat
tv
traditional
seating
and
i
admired
the
fabric
based
headboards
those
are
very
nice
walking
distance
to
restaurants
were
convenient
igm
a
highly
frequent
traveler
to
chicago
almost
years
now
and
always
stay
with
relatives
in
any
event
igd
recommend
staying
at
the
monaco
again

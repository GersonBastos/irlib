while

had
stayed
in
the
hotel
monaco
before
this
was
my
husbandgs
first
trip
to
chicago
and
i
insisted
we
stay
here
as
i
loved
it
the
first
time
well
the
second
stay
was
even
better
we
had
one
of
the
corner
suites
on
the
river
the
service
was
excellent
and
staff
was
very
friendly
and
helpful
the
warm
cookies
in
the
afternoon
is
a
nice
touch
after
a
day
of
sightseeing
unfortunately
we
missed
the
wine
hour
one
thing
that
realy
impressed
me
is
that

c
of

got
to
chicago
a
day
late
hotel
monaco

waived
the
cost
of
the
first
night
on
our
room
even
though
it
was
a
guaranteed
reservation

just
what
i
needed
at
jamesg
i
cangt
tell
you
how
impressed
i
was
with
my
stay
at
the
james
chicago
hotel
i
came
into
town
for
a
week
long
business
conference
and
was
referred
to
the
james
by
a
friend
the
crisp
clean
contemporary
ambiance
made
me
feel
like
i
was
on
a
relaxed
vacation
rather
than
work
it
was
luxury
without
being
over
the
top
my
room
was
clean
comfortable
and
was
above
all
standards
comfortable
in
my
down
time
i
enjoyed
a
relaxing
massage
at
the
spa
and
happy
hour
at
the
jbar
and
i
highly
recommend
dinner
at
the
david
burke
primehouse
the
customer
service
from
all
the
staff
members
from
front
desk
to
house
keeping
to
the
bartender
was
excellent
i
plan
on
returning
on
my
spring
vist
and
look
forward
to
another
phenomenal
experience

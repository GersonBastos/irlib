this
is
an
absolutely
exquisite
hotel
at
a
great
location
and
boasting
superb
amenities
i
was
here
on
a
personal
trip
and
really
enjoyed
being
so
close
to
the
shopping
on
michigan
ave
the
hotel
itself
has
a
pleasant
ambiance
and
the
staff
made
me
feel
welcome
and
quickly
responded
to
my
requests
for
various
items
from
the
front
desk
i
appreciated
the
homey
well
designed
interior
and
views
of
the
city
it
was
also
nice
to
have
good
food
at
my
disposal
late
night
so
i
didngt
have
to
wander
the
city
for
my
late
night
meal
this
will
definitely
be
my
hotel
of
choice
when
i
return
to
the
city

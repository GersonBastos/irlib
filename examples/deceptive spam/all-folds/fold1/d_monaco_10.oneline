i
recently
stayed
at
the
hotel
monaco
and
i
must
say
it
has
become
one
of
my
favorite
hotels
in
the
windy
city
in
the
past
igve
always
stayed
at
the
marriott
or
the
hilton
so
this
time
i
thought
igd
go
with
a
boutique
hotel
igve
stayed
at
some
of
the
kimpton
properties
in
san
francisco
so
i
was
delighted
that
they
are
running
the
monaco
basically
i
like
the
friendly
real
people
atmosphere
as
opposed
to
the
corporate
style
places
igve
used
before
i
do
work
out
and
they
had
a
decent
fitness
center
with
the
treadmill
i
normally
use
south
water
kitchen
served
a
terrific
meal
even
in
a
city
of
great
restaurants
i
really
dug
the
complimentary
coffee
high
speed
internet
and
newspaper
i
get
tired
of
being
nickel
and
dimed
by
the
corporate
hotels
and
liked
the
fact
that
the
monaco
offered
a
bunch
of
freebies
especially
liked
the
afternoon
wine
service
all
in
all
i
will
return
to
the
monaco
itgs
a
great
alternative

sometimes
you
just
cangt
find
fault
with
a
hotel
even
if
you
tried
such
was
the
case
with
sofitel
where
wegd
never
stayed
before
itgs
a
sleek
modern
sophisticated
hotel
with
european
touches
we
spent
three
days
there
on
a
leisure
weekend
we
had
a
floor
king
room
looking
directly
at
the
hancock
building
at
a
total
cost
including
taxes
and
lugs
of
about
a
night
the
room
was
average
sized
well
appointed
everything
in
it
worked
and
it
had
a
fabulous
view
of
the
chicago
high
rise
jungle
including
snippets
of
the
lake
the
public
areas
were
wonderfully
decorated
the
restaurant
served
a
good
breakfast
at
for
chicago
reasonable
prices
the
staff
was
excellent
my
wife
broke
her
ankle
several
weeks
before
we
visited
and
was
on
crutches
the
staff
loaned
us
a
wheelchair
and
was
very
helpful
in
assisting
her

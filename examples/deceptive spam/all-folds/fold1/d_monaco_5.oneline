i
frequently
have
business
meetings
in
downtown
chicago
and
find
that
the
hotel
monaco
chicago
gives
me
the
peace
of
mind
to
make
those
meetings
enjoyable
while
it
might
be
more
expensive
than
your
average
hotel
but
there
is
nothing
average
in
this
hotel
exceeds
any
expectations
service
food
quality
atmosphere
were
heads
above
anywhere
thanks
for
making
my
trips
to
chicago
the
best
of
the
best

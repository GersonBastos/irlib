i
stayed
at
the
james
in
june
and
i
must
say
it
felt
like
i
was
in
some
ultra
swanky
boutqiue
hotel
from
the
uniforms
of
the
staff
which
consists
of
a
small
j
pin
that
they
wear
with
nice
suits
and
such
to
the
wonderful
comfortable
beds
the
james
just
makes
you
feel
ultra
relaxed
the
gym
in
the
hotel
was
fantastic
for
a
hotel
gym
and
the
machines
were
all
new
and
in
fantastic
condition
i
really
enjoyed
the
complimentary
kiehlgs
products
as
well
as
the
soft
cushy
beds
with
futons
location
wise
itgs
just
off
michigan
ave
and
itgs
close
to
all
the
shops
and
restaurants
igd
definitely
stay
here
if
igm'
ever
back
in
chicago

went
to
chicago
for
a
week
in
may
decided
to
be
good
to
ourselves
and
stay
in
the
hilton
we
were
not
disapointed
perhaps
it
was
becuse
there
were
quite
a
few
conventions
going
on
and
a
lot
of
people
were
only
staying
or
nights
but
we
got
upgraged
to
exceutive
level
we
had
double
beds
with
a
bathroom
each
they
beds
and
pillows
were
too
die
for
so
so
comfy
ant
the
end
of
a
day
when
we
seemed
to
have
walked
for
miles
all
the
staff
were
very
helpful
a
lot
of
guests
seemed
to
ignore
the
staff
especially
the
chamber
maids
who
they
seemed
to
think
they
were
in
their
way
so
perhaps
that
why
some
people
felt
these
people
were
rude
or
unhelpful
about
blocks
away
on
harrison
is
a
cafe
called
orange
which
you
have
to
make
the
only
place
you
will
have
breakfast
the
cafe
and
the
staff
are
suberb
expect
a
min
wait
on
a
sat
sun
morning

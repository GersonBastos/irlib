my
husband
and
i
recently
stayed
at
the
sofitel
chicago
water
tower
for
our
wedding
anniversary
and
what
a
pleasant
stay
we
had
from
the
first
moment
we
walked
in
we
were
overwhelmed
at
the
classy
elegance
of
the
lobby
i
casually
mentioned
that
it
was
our
anniversary
and
after
we
came
back
from
dinner
we
found
champagne
and
strawberries
awaiting
us
in
the
room
the
staff
was
professional
but
friendly
and
made
us
feel
so
welcome
the
room
was
immaculate
the
furnishings
were
so
plush
we
didngt
really
want
to
go
home
room
service
was
prompt
and
the
views
were
spectacular
we
are
definitely
going
to
make
this
visit
a
yearly
repeat

stayed
here
for
a
weekend
while
visiting
some
friends
in
town
it
was
a
little
pricey
but
definitely
worth
it
the
staff
was
super
friendly
the
pool
was
clean
and
well
maintained
and
they
even
had
a
really
good
veggie
burger
in
the
restaurant
downstairs

vegetarian

i
paid
for
a
room
with
a
lake
view
and
it
was
gorgeous

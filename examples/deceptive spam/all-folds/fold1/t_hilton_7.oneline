we
booked
our
stay
through
priceline
com
and
got
a
great
deal
we
were
only
staying
one
night
and
we
had
our
year
old
with
us
at
check
in
we
were
upgraded
to
a
suite
with
a
lake
view
of
lake
michigan
it
was
beautiful
the
suite
had
a
king
bed
with
a
living
room
and
a
bar
and
mini
fridge
which
we
didngt
need
but
if
we
were
staying
longer
it
would
have
been
a
godsend
this
hotel
is
in
close
proximity
with
grant
park
which
has
the
beautiful
buckingham
fountain
we
walked
around
the
park
and
even
saw
a
movie
being
filmed
but
if
you
are
looking
for
a
hotel
with
a
lot
of
restaurants
around
it
this
isngt
the
one
we
ended
up
eating
at
the
irish
pub
inside
the
hotel
kitty
ogshea's
which
has
great
food
we
have
stayed
here
before
and
always
end
up
eating
here
there
are
a
lot
of
attractions
within
a
mile
including
the
field
museum
shedd
aquarium
soldier
field
and
navy
pier
they
may
not
be
walking
distance
but
we
could
see
them
from
our
hotel
window
overall
we
had
another
wonderful
stay
at
the
chicago
hilton
our
stay
the
only
downside
is
the
expensive
parking
within
the
hotel
dollars
a
night
is
kind
of
ridiculous

last
week
i
stayed
at
the
hilton
chicago
for
days
and
nights
and
i
was
very
pleased
with
the
experience
as
soon
as
i
approached
the
front
desk
i
knew
right
away
the
staff
was
friendly
and
courteous
they
had
given
me
a
list
of
local
attractions
such
as
the
museum
of
science
and
industry
the
broadcast
museum
the
ford
center
for
the
performing
arts
and
willis
tower
i
stayed
in
a
junior
suite
which
included
a
king
size
bed
a
inch
television
non
allergenic
feather
pillows
and
a
variety
of
other
amenities
the
indoor
pool
was
rather
large
as
well
as
the
gym
which
includes
countless
treadmills
and
even
a
jogging
track
eating
in
the
area
is
not
a
problem
as
the
hilton
chicago
is
home
to
kitty
ogsheas
which
is
a
restaurant
offering
authentic
irish
fare
in
conclusion
i
had
a
wonderful
time
staying
here
and
i
can
not
wait
to
plan
my
return
trip
to
the
hilton
chicago

the
sofitel
water
tower
was
a
wonderful
place
to
stay
for
my
husband
and
me
for
our
anniversary
weekend
trip
to
chicago
we
got
married
in
the
city
but
then
moved
away
and
it
was
so
romantic
to
return
we
loved
how
near
the
sofitel
was
to
everything
the
magnificent
mile
was
just
outside
our
door
and
we
could
walk
to
navy
pier
and
other
attractions
as
well
chicago
has
changed
but
the
sofitel
made
it
feel
like
home
again
except
a
very
plush
and
elegant
version
of
home
we
stayed
in
a
junior
suite
which
had
great
views
of
the
city
and
room
service
was
very
attentive
when
we
called
for
champagne
after
midnight
the
day
we
arrived
both
nights
before
leaving
for
supper
we
had
a
cocktail
in
le
bar
and
enjoyed
talking
about
what
wegd
done
during
the
day
and
all
the
great
memories
this
town
has
for
us
but
i
have
to
say
we
have
some
new
great
memories
now
thanks
to
the
sofitel
water
tower

the
james
hotel
is
located
close
to
everything
in
chicago
the
miracle
mile
pizza
house
uno
rush
street
the
water
tower
everything
we
walked
everywhere
because
everything
was
close
by
the
rooms
are
very
modern
and
a
little
on
the
small
side
but
the
bed
was
very
comfortable
very
the
service
is
very
good
and
the
calls
are
answered
professionally
and
nicely
all
service
was
very
fast
and
through
the
lobby
is
a
liitle
small
but
that
keeps
the
riff
raff
from
hanging
out
in
it
the
bar
service
was
good
the
drink
prices
were
high
but
what
do
you
expect
in
a
hotel
bar
i
got
a
great
deal
from
leading
hotels
of
the
world
for
my
stay
of
days
was
just
over
for
a
star
hotel
thatgs
cheap
due
to
the
location
price
and
service
i
may
stay
there
again
but
i
think
my
next
trip
may
take
me
to
trumpgs
hotel
in
chi
town
the
james
is
a
good
stay
the
doorman
at
the
hotel
are
great
always
pleasent
with
a
smile
and
very
good

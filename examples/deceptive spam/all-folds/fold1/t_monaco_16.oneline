having
had
a
great
stay
at
the
monaco
last
fall
with
friends
i
was
disappointed
initially
to
arrive
on
saturday
with
husband
and
find
that
they
didngt
have
our
quikbook
made
reservation
in
their
system
and
they
had
no
rooms
available
for
sat
eve
but
they
immediately
took
responsibility
for
their
mistake
by
doing
the
followingg
found
us
a
nice
room
at
the
neighboring
swissotel
and
paid
for
it
gave
us
cab
fare
to
get
the
blocks
over
there
paid
for
our
valet
parking
that
eve
so
naturally
when
they
asked
if
we
were
interested
in
returning
for
sunday
eve
when
they
did
have
room
we
said
yes
when
we
returned
they
gave
us
a
corner
suite
with
jacuzzi
tub
for
our
quikbook
rate
now
thatgs
what
i
call
a
recovery

my
stay
was
quick
but
awesome
after
a
long
day
seeing
a
substantial
line
at
check
in
was
a
bit
of
a
groaner
but
then
i
saw
the
self
serve
kiosks
i
was
checked
in
with
keys
in
hand
in
under
minutes
in
the
morning
i
was
able
to
check
out
on
the
tv
in
my
room
the
hotel
is
a
beautiful
historic
landmark
with
all
the
amenities
of
a
modern
hotel
and
all
the
charm
of
its
origins
the
bed
was
fabulously
comfortable
i
wish
i
could
live
there
they
have
many
rooms
wtih
bathrooms
i
stayed
in
a
room
like
that
once
with
a
friend
and
we
didngt
know
ahead
of
time
that
we
had
two
bathrooms
talk
about
squeals
of
delight
that
was
about
years
ago
in
virginia
beach
i
was
by
myself
at
the
hilton
and
had
no
need
for
a
room
with
two
bathrooms
but
itgs
the
first
time
igve
seen
this
since
what
a
great
feature

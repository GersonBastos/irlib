i
stayed
here
for
a
conference
and
got
the
conference
rate
of
i
was
worried
that
i
wouldngt
get
a
nice
room
since
it
was
the
weekend
before
the
election
and
the
hotel
is
across
the
street
from
grant
park
so
it
could
easily
have
gotten
a
lot
more
for
the
nicer
rooms
i
requested
a
quiet
room
away
from
elevators
and
foot
traffic
and
that
is
exactly
what
i
was
assigned
perhaps
because
i
am
also
a
gsilver'
member
it
was
a
beautiful
room
with
windows
on
two
sides
a
king
sized
bed
the
room
was
quiet
comfortable
and
immaculate
the
maid
even
left
a
thank
you
note
for
the
tip
i
had
left
all
the
staff
were
helpful
polite
and
cheerful
i
appreciated
the
fact
that
i
could
actually
purchase
a
breakfast
for
under
oatmeal
coffee
and
juice
something
not
possible
at
a
lot
of
big
hotels
like
the
hyatt
i
stayed
at
last
year

hotel
monaco
is
in
a
really
great
location
only
a
block
away
from
the
miracle
mile
and
a
couple
of
blocks
from
millenium
park
sears
tower
is
also
well
within
walking
distance
and
if
you
dongt
mind
walking
you
wongt
have
a
problem
walking
to
greek
town
and
lincoln
park
we
did
the
daily
complimentary
wine
hour
is
a
really
nice
touch
that
we
unfortunately
were
only
around
once
to
try
out
if
you
can
leave
your
car
behind
you
wongt
need
it
and
the
parking
is
quite
pricey
which
is
not
very
surprising
considering
the
location
everything
was
clean
fresh
and
modern
and
the
staff
very
helpful
the
only
bad
thing
was
that
the
noise
from
the
elevated
train
around
the
loop
was
quite
loud
and
that
our
room
happened
to
be
next
to
the
maidgs
supply
room
so
it
was
quite
busy
in
the
morning

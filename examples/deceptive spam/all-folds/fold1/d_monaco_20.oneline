our
experience
at
hotel
monaco
was
wonderful
my
fiancee
and
i
stayed
two
nights
in
the
tranquility
suite
absolutely
exquisite
we
had
wonderful
room
service
and
practically
never
had
to
leave
our
room
except
to
go
to
the
gym
g
i
was
able
to
do
yoga
on
the
trip
because
they
had
yoga
accessories
in
the
room
i
was
surprised
by
that
this
hotel
was
the
definition
of
gluxury'
they
had
anything
we
needed
and
more
my
fiancee
said
we
were
staying
at
a
really
gnice'
hotel
but
i
had
no
idea
until
we
walked
in
the
door
as
soon
as
you
walk
in
you
are
met
with
the
charming
atmosphere
and
luxurious
decor
i
have
to
admit
cheesy
as
it
may
sound
i
felt
like
a
queen
all
weekend
long
g
most
of
the
time
i
have
at
least
one
problem
with
the
hotel
i
stayed
at
but
i
have
to
say
at
this
point
i
have
no
complaints
at
all
about
hotel
monaco
and
i
will
definitely
look
forward
to
staying
there
again
during
my
next
trip
to
chicago

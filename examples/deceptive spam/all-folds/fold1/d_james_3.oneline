our
stay
at
the
james
in
late
last
august
exceeded
our
expectations
my
husband
was
in
chicago
for
a
business
trip
and
i
tagged
along
to
have
some
time
away
from
our
day
to
day
life
when
we
entered
the
hotel
we
were
greeted
acknowledged
the
minute
we
walked
through
the
doors
and
the
staff
member
at
the
front
desk
was
extremely
friendly
he
met
our
needs
in
a
timely
manner
and
patiently
answered
our
questions
the
lobby
was
clean
and
the
ambiance
was
impressive
our
room
was
also
very
clean
i
could
not
have
found
a
better
room
for
those
two
nights
of
peace
and
quiet
the
bed
was
comfortable
and
the
bedding
was
the
type
you
could
slip
into
and
drift
off
in
it
has
been
awhile
since
i
have
stayed
at
a
hotel
where
the
comforter
was
not
scratchy
or
too
thin
my
husband
actually
commented
that
he
had
not
seen
me
sleep
that
soundly
in
over
a
month
the
bathroom
was
also
impressive
the
water
pressure
was
not
something
i
had
to
mess
with
to
get
perfect
and
the
heater
took
no
time
at
all
to
warm
up
even
though
i
had
brought
my
own
shampoo
and
conditioner
i
did
give
the
amenities
in
the
bathroom
a
try
and
like
everything
else
they
exceeded
my
expectations
i
did
not
get
a
chance
to
check
out
the
conference
rooms
however
my
husband
had
nothing
but
great
things
to
say
about
the
qualities
of
the
facilities
i
truly
enjoyed
the
location
and
ambiance
of
this
hotel
and
if
we
are
ever
in
the
chicago
area
again
we
will
definitely
be
staying
here
this
hotel
met
all
of
our
needs
from
relaxation
to
business
to
pleasure

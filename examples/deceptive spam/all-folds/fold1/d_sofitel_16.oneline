i
think
the
sofitel
chicago
water
tower
is
a
upscale
place
i
had
my
wedding
there
and
it
was
the
best
of
the
best
the
staff
was
so
helpful
and
made
me
feel
confident
that
my
wedding
would
be
a
success
the
chef
prepared
a
lavish
sit
down
dinner
with
appetizers
and
desserts
they
also
had
a
wonderful
pastry
chef
who
baked
my
wedding
cake
the
tables
were
decorated
in
very
good
taste
and
could
not
be
more
perfect
the
bar
was
also
set
up
the
way
i
wanted
it
and
even
had
a
champagne
fountain
my
guests
had
a
wonderful
experience
with
their
stay
at
the
hotel
and
felt
pampered
the
rooms
were
like
suites
with
a
mini
bar
they
had
terry
cloth
bathrobes
in
each
bathroom
if
you
are
looking
to
have
a
wedding
in
the
chicago
area
look
into
having
it
here
you
will
not
be
disappointed

i
believe
i
can
not
describe
how
amazing
was
our
stay
at
the
james
service
was
impecable
from
the
door
man
to
the
front
desk
location
could
not
be
better
yes
you
can
hear
the
ambulances
in
the
street
from
the
floor
but
come
on
you
are
downtown
what
do
you
expect
overall
noise
was
not
in
a
level
to
bother
us
the
only
minor
incident
was
a
cleaner
that
tried
to
open
our
room
to
clean
at
pm
pm
not
am
go
figure

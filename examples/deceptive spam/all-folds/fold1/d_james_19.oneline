recently
my
husband
and
i
stayed
at
the
james
in
chicago
for
our
night
on
the
town
after
taking
in
a
musical
we
checked
in
at
the
james
and
were
happily
surprised
with
the
customer
appreciation
and
delicious
room
service
the
rooms
were
spotless
and
we
were
supplied
with
fresh
towels
for
everything
from
showers
to
the
spa
to
visiting
the
gym
if
i
had
known
that
they
accepted
pets
beforehand
it
wouldgve
been
a
great
environment
for
our
family
lapdog
staying
at
the
james
in
chicago
made
our
night
a
luxurious
outing
and
will
be
a
definite
stop
next
time
we
are
in
chicago

i
just
got
back
from
the
monaco
in
chicago
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
as
my
husband
booked
this
trip
as
a
last
minute
getaway
and
he
usually
picks
bad
places
haha
anyway
the
moment
we
got
there
the
doormen
greeted
us
warmly
and
helped
get
our
luggage
situatated
it
was
busy
and
the
line
was
a
little
long
but
it
moved
quickly
the
lady
at
the
front
desk
gave
us
a
high
floor
when
we
requested
one
which
was
very
good
especially
since
it
seemed
to
be
near
full
the
room
was
clean
and
spacious
especially
considering
itgs
a
city
hotel
we
made
a
lot
of
use
of
the
concierge
since
again
it
was
so
last
minute
we
didngt
really
make
any
plans
he
gave
us
some
tips
and
also
gave
us
a
few
places
we
should
go
for
chicago
pizza
yummy
it
was
also
great
being
near
the
theater
district
and
basically
in
the
thick
of
everything
so
we
saved
on
cab
fare
i
thought
the
coolest
thing
was
they
brought
you
a
goldfish
in
a
bowl
for
your
room
very
trendy
my
husband
is
not
as
easily
impressed
but
he
was
really
excited
about
the
free
wine
hour
and
the
free
drinks
in
the
afternoon
overall
really
nice
stay
in
a
four
star
or
probably
four
and
half
star
hotel

my
stay
at
the
hotel
monaco
recently
was
fantastic
we
got
a
very
reasonable
price
for
our
stay
especially
since
we
were
a
aaa
member
and
there
was
plenty
of
perks
to
utilizeg
in
room
spa
treatments
and
an
evening
wine
wine
hour
to
name
a
few
another
thing
that
the
kids
really
enjoyed
was
that
upon
request
the
staff
brought
us
a
fish
in
its
own
fishbowl
for
our
room
how
cool
is
that
the
staff
were
all
very
helpful
and
friendly
and
our
stay
was
very
enjoyable
i
would
definitely
recommend
the
hotel
monaco
to
anyone
in
the
downtown
chicago
area

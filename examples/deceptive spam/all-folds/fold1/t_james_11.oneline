i
found
this
wonderful
hotel
the
location
is
awesome
just
minutes
away
from
all
the
shopping
restaurants
and
bars
you
could
possibly
want
i
was
in
town
for
an
interview
so
i
was
really
nervous
i
ended
up
suggesting
the
hotel
restaurant
for
my
interview
and
they
took
such
a
good
care
of
us
they
made
me
feel
so
comfortable
that
i
was
hardly
nervous
at
all
and
the
place
was
pack
the
room
was
superb
really
cool
design
i
had
a
room
they
call
an
apartment
and
it
was
fantastic
the
natural
light
you
get
in
this
room
is
awesome
and
i
am
very
sensitive
to
dark
places
they
have
a
full
bar
in
the
room
which
i
was
able
to
use
to
entertain
my
friends
that
night
i
went
to
the
gym
for
a
little
bit
of
exercise
and
i
have
to
say
i
have
never
seen
such
a
extensive
facility
in
a
hotel
all
the
staff
made
me
feel
like
i
was
family
they
were
available
to
me
at
any
time
and
so
friendly
i
will
definitely
be
back
for
another
stay

staying
at
this
hotel
was
one
of
the
high
points
of
a
last
minute
budget
valentines
weekend
trip
for
my
husband
and
me
we
got
a
great
rate
on
priceline
close
to
the
subway
red
line
and
we
got
from
oghare
to
the
hotel
in
less
than
an
hour
for
for
both
of
us
we
were
able
to
check
in
more
than
hours
early
room
was
great
very
clean
good
closet
space
and
fantastic
bedding
had
one
expensive
drink
at
the
irish
bar
but
the
bartendergs
advice
on
restaurants
and
clubs
to
check
out
made
it
worth
the
price
concierge
was
helpful
too
overall
service
was
terrific
room
was
great
and
staying
there
was
a
treat
i
would
stay

at
that
price

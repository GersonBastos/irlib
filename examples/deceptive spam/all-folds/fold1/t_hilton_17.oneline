we
had
our
hotel
reservations
at
another
hotel
set
and
after
we
were
reading
all
of
the
negative
reviews
we
cancelled
and
made
out
reservation
at
the
hilton
i
am
so
glad
we
did
the
hotel
was
clean
hotel
staff
was
pleasant
and
helpful
and
the
beds
were
amazing
we
knew
we
were
paying
a
little
more
than
some
other
hotels
but
it
was
well
worth
every
penny

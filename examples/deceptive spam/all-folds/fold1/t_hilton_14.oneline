we
travel
to
chicago
regularly
and
have
always
wanted
to
stay
at
the
hilton
chicago
we
booked
a
priceline
room
on
the
weekend
of
the
half
marathon
the
place
was
busy
but
the
staff
certainly
found
time
for
each
individual
guest
the
room
was
nice
and
just
what
we
expected
the
pool
area
is
also
very
nice
for
a
downtown
hotel
the
location
was
great
as
we
were
taking
in
the
bears
game
on
a
thursday
night
and
a
sox
game
on
a
friiday
night
we
would
certainly
stay
there
again
and
would
recomment
it
to
others
great
quality
even
at
the
regular
room
price

my
husband
and
i
wanted
to
spend
the
weekend
in
chicago
to
celebrate
our
anniversary
and
i
had
been
looking
at
the
james
for
awhile
because
it
was
attached
to
david
burkegs
primehouse
from
the
moment
i
called
to
make
my
reservation
i
knew
this
hotel
understood
what
customer
service
means
to
a
consumer
and
a
picky
one
at
that
from
the
pre
arrival
dossier
to
the
special
sweets
from
the
staff
to
kick
off
our
anniversary
weekend
and
a
hand
written
note
thanking
us
for
staying
at
the
james
this
staff
is
well
versed
in
the
long
lost
art
of
customer
service
the
rooms
were
well
appointed
and
the
beds
comfy
and
warm
on
a
cool
weekend
the
walking
distance
to
michigan
av
is
a
huge
plus
from
the
front
desk
to
the
cleaning
staff
the
staff
here
is
top
notch
and
david
burkegs
primehouse
is
not
to
be
missed

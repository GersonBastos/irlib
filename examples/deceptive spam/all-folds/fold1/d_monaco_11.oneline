hotel
monaco
is
simply
amazing
i
travel
quite
a
bit
and
am
use
to
generic
hotels
with
horribly
unimpressive
rooms
and
star
amenities
which
usually
mean
a
packet
of
instant
coffee
and
room
service
that
wongt
serve
after
hotel
monaco
on
the
other
hand
was
very
impressive
the
suite
i
stayed
in
was
stylish
and
cozy
this
hotel
has
such
personality
my
absolute
favorite
part
of
my
stay
aside
from
the
amazing
meal
i
had
down
stairs
was
the
in
room
spa
treatment
hotel
monaco
just
raised
the
bar
on
hotels
for
me
generic
just
wongt
do
anymore

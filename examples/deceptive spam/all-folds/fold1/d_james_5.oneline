the
james
hotel
in
chicago
is
by
far
one
of
the
best
hotels
that
my
family
and
i
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
staying
at
the
room
service
is
the
best
in
the
area
not
to
mention
the
spa
in
the
hotel
is
to
die
for
the
lobby
and
the
reception
area
is
very
contemporary
this
is
a
great
place
to
take
the
family
to
relax
i
would
recommend
this
hotel
to
anyone

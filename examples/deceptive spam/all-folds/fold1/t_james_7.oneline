the
james
was
perfect

the
room
through
a
package
w
american
express
for
a
great
deal

though
the
view
wasngt
great
the
space
decor
and
location
cangt
be
beat
staff
was
friendly
courteous
and
very
helpful
the
gym
was
substantial
and
though
i
didngt
try
the
restaurants
room
service
the
menus
looked
yummy
igve
stayed
in
chgo
in
that
area
on
avg

the
past

at
the
top

this
was
really
an
unexpected
experience
for
me
as
far
as
hotel
accommodations
go
for
this
weekgs
vacation
in
chicago
i
heard
several
recommendations
regarding
lodging
but
the
james
chicago
was
mentioned
most
emphatically
i
expected
an
experience
of
comfort
luxury
and
customer
satisfaction
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
level
of
innovation
and
forward
thinking
employed
by
every
aspect
of
this
hotel
the
design
is
breathtaking
modern
clean
stylish
sexy
and
its
reflected
everywhere
from
the
lobby
shops
and
restaurants
to
the
stunning
guest
rooms
themselves
my
family
and
i
felt
energized
by
the
smartly
sleek
environment
we
were
in
and
were
impressed
at
every
turn
by
the
sophisticated
take
on
hotel
decor
far
from
a
traditional
hotel
experience
this
was
like
moving
into
chic
exclusive
downtown
apartment
and
truly
an
upscale
adventure
in
modern
luxury
living
impressive
too
was
the
hotelgs
overall
approach
to
its
guests
and
its
use
of
the
worldgs
resources
from
its
offer
of
in
room
recycling
to
the
available
bicycles
for
guest
usage
the
james
offers
a
unique
perspective
on
its
place
in
the
world
and
gently
helps
its
guests
assist
in
maintaining
that
balance
with
ease
and
elegance
itgs
a
respect
that
shows
through
too
in
other
areasg
support
for
artistic
organizations
charities
and
other
programs
of
merit
as
well
as
chicago
centric
packages
compiled
for
guests
so
they
can
make
the
best
of
their
stay
whether
for
a
weekend
a
week
or
longer
the
james
chicago
will
definitely
be
our
choice
for
accommodations
whenever
we
revisit
chicago
in
fact
we
may
visit
again
solely
to
stay
at
the
james

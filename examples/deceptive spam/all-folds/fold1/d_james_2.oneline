i
am
often
traveling
on
business
and
i
always
try
to
stay
at
the
james
the
modern
design
of
the
lobby
and
restaurant
with
wood
and
glass
creates
a
luxurious
atmosphere
and
the
streamlined
comfortable
room
design
give
an
upscale
aesthetic
like
that
of
a
penthouse
loft
apartment
the
availability
of
computers
and
coffee
in
the
jamesg
business
centers
means
i
do
not
have
to
lug
my
laptop
around
the
hotel
the
james
provides
the
perfect
setting
for
business
travelers
and
is
a
cozy
place
to
retire
to
in
the
evenings
the
ease
of
breakfast
service
in
the
rooms
means
that
i
do
not
have
to
stress
or
rush
as
my
time
is
valuable
i
love
the
james

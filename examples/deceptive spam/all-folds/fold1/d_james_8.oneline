we
enjoyed
our
stay
at
the
james
in
chicago
very
much
the
hotel
is
elegant
and
uber
modern
each
room
simply
exudes
class
i
have
never
stayed
in
a
nicer
hotel
to
be
honest
the
hotel
features
an
upscale
restaurant
though
it
is
within
walking
distance
of
many
great
dining
establishments
there
is
also
a
full
service
spa
at
the
hotel
the
most
surprising
thing
about
the
james
is
that
pets
are
allowedg
our
dog
didngt
have
to
stay
at
home
how
cool
is
that
there
are
also
lots
of
up
scale
amenities
like
valet
parking
hour
room
service
hour
concierge
shoe
shine
service
and
laundry
dry
cleaning
the
hotel
is
located
right
on
the
magnificent
mile
so
that
location
is
absolutely
superb
you
are
literally
steps
away
from
some
of
the
best
dining
and
shopping
in
the
world
i
would
recommend
the
james
to
anyone
on
business
or
looking
to
stay
in
upscale
luxury
on
a
jaunt
to
chicago

this
is
one
of
the
best
hotels
i
have
ever
been
in
i
went
there
to
see
about
scheduling
my
reception
party
and
was
amazed
at
the
architecture
of
the
building
the
interior
design
of
the
rooms
and
the
massive
spacing
provided
for
each
room
now
i
recommend
this
hotel
to
my
associates
to
hold
their
important
business
meetings
in
the
james
club
so
that
after
the
meetings
we
can
partake
in
a
nice
meal
and
drinks
which
brings
me
to
my
next
point
the
james
has
some
of
the
best
food
i
have
ever
eaten
the
james
private
club
i
feel
was
made
for
the
elite
and
upper
class
very
classy
very
elegant
the
customer
service
is
outstanding
i
recommend
this
hotel
to
anyone
needing
to
hold
a
reception
business
meeting
or
just
need
to
have
a
day
at
the
spa
stars
all
the
way

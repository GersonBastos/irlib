the
downtown
chicago
hilton
was
the
best
combination
of
all
the
things
we
were
looking
for
in
a
hotel
perfect
location
for
both
those
of
us
who
like
shopping
and
those
of
us
who
prefer
tourist
attractions
staying
with
a
hilton
means
the
essentials
are
never
a
concern
as
always
the
room
was
clean
and
impeccably
neat
the
staff
friendly
and
very
capable
the
wireless
access
and
big
flat
screen
tv
were
an
added
plus
too
best
of
all
it
is
a
pet
friendly
hotel
something
that
is
unusual
in
bigger
city
diamond
hotels
thanks
chicago
hilton
for
a
great
stay

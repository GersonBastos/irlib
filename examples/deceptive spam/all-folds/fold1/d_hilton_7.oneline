my
family
chose
to
stay
at
the
chicago
hilton
during
our
last
trip
to
the
city
we
wanted
something
luxurious
and
centrally
located
without
having
to
pay
exorbitant
prices
i
can
honestly
say
we
made
an
excellent
decision
in
picking
the
hilton
the
staff
treated
us
well
the
rooms
were
clean
and
roomy
we
loved
the
serenity
beds
and
the
hotel
itself
is
stunning
it
was
like
stepping
back
in
time
we
loved
that
the
chicago
hilton
was
close
to
numerous
attractions
the
weather
was
lovely
so
it
was
great
to
walk
to
navy
pier
sears
tower
and
the
adler
planetarium
we
will
definitely
stay
at
the
hilton
the
next
time
we
are
in
chicago

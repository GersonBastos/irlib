stayed
here
as
a
treat
to
myself
while
in
chicago
recently
for
a
concert
i
totally
loved
it
here
when
you
called
either
the
front
desk
or
room
service
the
phone
was
answered
with
hallo
mrs
name
which
was
a
great
personal
touch
vanessa
at
the
front
desk
went
out
her
way
to
help
me
storing
some
things
in
a
safe
for
me
before
i
could
book
into
my
room
my
room
was
wonderful
the
bathroom
was
luxurious
i
was
on
the
floor
and
the
views
were
superb
we
ordered
room
service
and
it
came
quickly
and
the
guy
was
so
friendly
and
nice
the
doormen
were
great
too
and
i
wore
jeans
and
a
tshirt
one
day
and
they
still
opened
the
door
for
me
so
no
snobbery
there
comfortable
cozy
bathrobes
were
available
in
the
bathroom
the
lights
went
on
in
the
wardrobe
never
seen
that
before
tv
was
hd
ready
and
flat
screen
the
bed
was
like
sleeping
on
a
cloud
best
sleep
for
a
while
would
i
stay
here
again
oh
yeah
no
problem
just
need
to
save
up
first

let
me
just
preface
this
by
saying
that
i
absolutely
loved
my
stay
at
this
hotel
i
chose
it
largely
for
location
as
i
dongt
really
love
to
walk
that
much
and
i
was
incredibly
pleased
with
its
situation
in
the
city
it
was
just
a
couple
blocks
away
from
several
museums
and
shopping
districts
but
my
husband
and
i
mainly
ventured
out
for
food
of
which
there
were
great
options
and
the
concierge
was
a
great
help
we
had
originally
booked
the
king
guestroom
but
upon
arrival
were
upgraded
to
the
deluxe
king
guestroom
by
the
front
desk
everyone
was
remarkably
friendly
and
helpful
which
is
something
i
look
for
and
remember
when
i
go
to
stay
in
a
location
again
our
room
was
amazing
seriously
amazing
it
was
so
chic
and
i
just
loved
the
headboard
over
our
bed
there
wasngt
one
little
spot
of
dust
to
be
found
the
bathroom
was
gorgeous
and
we
made
full
use
of
the
two
bathrobes
in
the
closet
we
didngt
take
anything
from
the
snack
bar
but
it
all
looked
delicious
we
had
dinner
at
david
burkegs
primehouse
i
cannot
recommend
the
ny
ribeye
more
highly
it
was
fantastic
for
dessert
we
had
the
brown
butter
corn
cake
igve
been
trying
to
replicate
that
dish
ever
since
i
got
home
igm
sad
to
say
that
i
didngt
get
a
chance
to
try
any
of
the
treatments
at
spa
by
asha
but
i
definitely
will
make
a
point
to
on
my
return
visit
the
james
chicago
made
our
trip
to
chicago
memorable
the
staff
was
friendly
the
hotel
beautiful
and
the
food
delicious
what
more
could
you
want

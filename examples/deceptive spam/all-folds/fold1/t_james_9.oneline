i
try
to
stay
at
the
james
every
time
i
happen
to
be
in
chicago
there
are
other
good
choices
in
town
but
nobody
has
what
the
james
offersg
superior
service
aka
class
meets
efficiency
metropolitan
design
and
comfort
with
an
attention
to
details
i
found
only
at
the
w
in
seoul
and
what
always
plays
a
role
meaning
a
convenient
location
then
they
get
to
you
with
small
unexpected
touches
that
make
the
difference
ieg
i
was
about
to
take
off
and
drive
north
it
was
a
hot
july
day
one
of
the
staff
members
handed
me
a
bottle
of
water
a
small
gesture
unexpected
and
appreciated
the
management
and
the
staff
understand
what
we
expect
and
more
importantly
what
we
need
and
they
consistenly
execute
against
that

this
is
a
great
hotel
from
the
doorman
who
greeted
us
as
we
arrived
to
the
young
man
at
the
reservation
desk
to
the
young
woman
serving
complimentarily
wine
everyone
was
very
friendly
and
helpful
we
were
strangers
but
for
a
minute
the
room
was
extremely
clean
well
appointed
and
we
had
a
pretty
view
of
the
chicago
river
especially
enjoyed
from
the
large
window
seats
loved
the
purple
polka
dot
paper
on
the
toilet
paper
roll
hallways
were
large
and
quiet
the
restaurant
next
door
south
water
kitchen
is
very
nice
too
the
location
is
in
walking
distance
of
the
theatres
parks
the
river
take
a
cruise
michigan
ave
itgs
ideal
the
only
negative
is
that
the
concierges
were
not
nearly
as
friendly
or
inviting
as
the
rest
of
the
staff
nor
were
they
very
helpful
for
a
self
sufficient
traveler
you
wouldngt
really
need
their
services
although
it
is
nice
but
for
someone
coming
to
chicago
for
the
first
time
a
concierge
can
be
very
helpful
i
would
definately
stay
at
this
hotel
again
and
would
recommend
it

i
stayed
at
the
hilton
chicago
for
my
cousins
wedding
the
service
was
impeccable
not
only
was
the
staff
attentive
they
were
respectful
and
careful
not
to
interrupt
the
guests
or
make
themselves
known
when
serving
dinner
i
had
the
chicken
wellington
and
it
was
to
die
for
the
chicken
was
perfect
and
moist
but
the
pastry
crust
was
flaky
and
crispy
they
even
had
pakistani
dinner
options
for
some
of
the
guests
the
amenities
were
great
and
after
an
open
bar
the
night
before
the
mimosas
and
brunch
buffet
couldngt
have
been
better
i
would
love
to
have
my
wedding
there

we
loved
the
hotel
when
i
see
other
posts
about
it
being
shabby
i
cangt
for
the
life
of
me
figure
out
what
they
are
talking
about
rooms
were
large
with
two
bathrooms
lobby
was
fabulous
pool
was
large
with
two
hot
tubs
and
huge
gym
staff
was
courteous
for
us
the
location
was
great
across
the
street
from
grant
park
with
a
great
view
of
buckingham
fountain
and
close
to
all
the
museums
and
theatres
igm
sure
others
would
rather
be
north
of
the
river
closer
to
the
magnificent
mile
but
we
enjoyed
the
quieter
and
more
scenic
location
got
it
for
on
hotwire
what
a
bargain
for
such
a
nice
hotel

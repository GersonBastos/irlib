i
stayed
at
the
monaco
for
the
labor
day
weekend
when
i
visited
my
family
in
chicago
it
is
one
of
the
nicest
hotels
i
have
stayed
at
in
my
life
clean
comfortable
and
pretty
the
rooms
were
clean
and
the
staff
is
very
caring
i
needed
some
more
glasses
as
my
family
was
sharing
drink
the
front
desk
had
them
sent
up
in
less
than
minutes
i

me
and
my
wife
recently
stayed
at
the
hilton
chicago
while
on
vacation
and
i
cangt
recommend
it
enough
the
hotel
is
located
right
on
michigan
avenue
in
downtown
chicago
and
right
next
to
tons
of
great
restaurants
and
stores
the
rooms
are
spacious
and
elegantg
they
are
modern
and
stylish
without
being
crazy
or
garish
i
especially
liked
the
big
flat
screen
tv
and
the
very
comfy
bed
sleeping
in
hotel
rooms
is
often
far
from
relaxing
but
i
had
no
problem
falling
asleep
i
highly
recommend
the
hilton
chicago
igll
definitely
stay
there
again

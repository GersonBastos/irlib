i
traveled
to
chicago
with
my
husband
for
a
romantic
weekend
away
our
stay
at
the
sofitel
chicago
water
tower
could
not
have
been
more
luxurious
our
room
had
anything
you
could
ever
want
a
mini
bar
air

we
were
also
within
walking
distance
of
many
sites
and
fun

the
staff
was
friendly
and
the
beds
were
like
clouds
overall
the
experience
was
worth
every
penny

i
stayed
in
on
of
the
james
one
bedroom
apartments
for
two
weeks
while
in
chicago
visiting
my
daughter
the
pre
arrival
assistant
was
incredibly
helpful
in
acquiring
some
necessities
i
forgot
to
pack
and
left
them
in
my
room
for
me
later
in
the
week
i
treated
myself
to
an
asha
massage
from
their
lengthy
list
of
delicious
spa
services
afterward
i
smelled
wonderful
and
was
the
most
relaxed
igd
been
in
years
my
room
was
clean
and
modern
yet
warm
and
comforting
with
dark
wood
tones
and
lush
bedding
igll
certainly
be
staying
with
them
again
in
the
future

this
was
my
first
time
in
chicago
and
wanted
a
hotel
that
was
in
a
good
location
this
definitely
fit
the
bill
i
could
walk
to
all
the
places
i
wanted
to
see
very
close
to
michigan
ave
and
the
magnificent
mile
about
a
minute
walk
to
the
art
institute
the
hotel
staff
was
very
friendly
and
went
out
of
their
way
to
be
helpful
there
was
coffee
in
the
lobby
every
morning
that
was
very
welcome
the
room
was
comfortable
and
clean
and
fairly
quiet
i
could
hear
the
train
and
some
traffic
from
the
street
considering
the
location
this
wasngt
bad
and
didngt
affect
my
ability
to
sleep
or
relax
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
hotel
a
gem

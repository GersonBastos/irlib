my
stay
here
was
superb
the
view
from
my
windows
was
stunning
as
i
looked
out
i
could
see
the
beautiful
grant
park
the
room
had
a
nice
airy
feel
but
was
also
warm
and
inviting
the
bed
was
very
comfortable
the
wireless
internet
was
fast
and
effective
which
is
nice
especially
when
on
business
trips
the
hotel
is
in
walking
distance
to
the
museum
which
is
nice
for
those
on
vaca
overall
i
thouroughly
enjoyed
my
stay
here

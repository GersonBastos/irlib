my
stay
at
the
hotel
monaco
chicago
was
amazing
the
staff
are
polite
and
well
poised
eager
to
give
a
helping
hand
in
a
short
notice
to
someone
like
me
who
had
never
even
been
in
the
city
of
chicago
it
really
gave
me
a
good
feeling
throughout
my
whole
trip
the
rooms
hallways
and
facilities
were
exceptionally
clean
and
tidy
and
whenver
i
went
out
i
would
always
find
my
room
perfect
g
be
it
for
a
night
of
undwinding
after
one
of
my
conferences
or
just
to
hit
the
mattress
and
sleep
during
my
stay
i
stopped
at
their
restuarant
where
i
had
one
of
the
best
american
style
meal
in
a
while
overall
the
hotel
monaco
is
a
place
i
would
surely
stay
at
again
if
given
the
chance
to
visit
chicago
for
a
second
time
it
is
truely
exceptional

my
wife
and
i
stayed
at
the
james
recently
and
we
had
a
great
experience
the
hotel
as
others
have
mentioned
is
in
an
ideal
location
itgs
in
a
quiet
location
yet
so
close
to
many
neighborhoods
that
you
want
to
go
to
we
upgraded
to
a
studio
room
which
was
totally
worth
the
additional
cost
it
didnt
have
all
the
midcentury
furniture
that
the
website
photos
have
but
it
was
elegantly
appointed
spacious
and
as
we
were
on
the
inside
of
the
building
very
quiet
the
service
was
amazing
everyone
was
extremely
friendly
and
helpful
as
well
as
knowledgeable
this
was
true
from
the
doormen
at
the
front
to
people
at
the
desk
and
the
servers
in
the
restaurant
both
concierges
that
we
dealt
with
had
great
suggestions
and
were
able
to
understand
our
style
and
sensibilities
when
helping
us
out
the
breakfast
at
prime
downstairs
is
among
the
best
i
have
ever
had
in
a
hotel
this
goes
for
the
room
service
as
well
dinner
there
was
good
but
not
great
i
mentioned
almost
flawless
as
there
was
a
situation
that
occurred
involving
the
spa
in
the
hotel
it
involved
scheduling
and
was
aggravating
as
the
hotel
actively
encourages
its
use
however
caroline
who
is
one
of
the
hotel
managers
did
an
amazingly
competent
job
of
making
sure
that
we
were
satisfied
following
up
on
progress
and
was
a
true
pleasure
to
deal
with
the
experience
could
have
left
a
very
bad
taste
in
my
mouth
but
was
resolved
quickly
overall
we
left
extremely
satisfied
with
our
stay
and
look
forward
to
many
future
visits

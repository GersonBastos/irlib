after
some
deliberation
i
booked
the
sofitel
water
tower
place
for
a
night
stop
over
in
june
this
was
my
first
visit
to
chicago
and
it
turned
out
that
we
had
a
really
great
time
we
loved
our
rooms
which
were
just
the
basic
type
on
the
lower
floors
but
they
were
very
well
appointed
the
decor
is
modern
and
personally
i
liked
it
a
lot
the
rooms
were
pleasant
and
airy
and
the
bed
extremely
comfortable
the
hotel
location
is
just
perfect
close
to
the
shops
on
michagan
avenue
and
the
beach
at
oak
street
lovely
restaurants
close
by
and
nightlife
in
rush
street
is
just
steps
away
the
area
although
bustling
was
peaceful
and
quiet
we
could
walk
to
most
places
and
i
would
not
hesitate
to
stay
here
again
the
hotel
staff
very
helpful
always
smiling
and
ready
to
helpg
from
the
doormen
to
the
helpful
lady
at
conceriage
i
would
not
hesitate
at
all
to
stay
at
sofitel
water
tower
place
next
time
igm
in
chicagog
in
fact
i
look
forward
to
my
next
visit

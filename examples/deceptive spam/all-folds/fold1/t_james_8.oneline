the
thing
that
makes
this
such
an
enjoyable
place
to
stay
is
the
staff
who
were
all
excellent
and
polite
and
the
service
was
impeccable
the
room
was
very
clean
the
beds
were
comfortable
but
it
was
a
little
small
and
the
water
in
the
bathroom
was
not
very
hot
other
than
that
it
was
a
great
place
to
stay

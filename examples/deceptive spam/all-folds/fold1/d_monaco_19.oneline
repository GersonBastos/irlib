upon
entering
the
hotel
monaco
chicago
i
could
see
the
beauty
of
a
classically
elegant
building
the
old
fashioned
furnishings
the
wonderful
view
and
the
polished
wood
decorating
the
entore
hotel
at
first
i
had
been
skeptical
but
any
doubts
i
had
carried
into
the
hotel
were
gone
as
i
entered
my
room
the
fresh
flowers
and
the
amazing
chicago
view
greeted
me
during
my
stay
i
enjoyed
my
free
time
lounging
by
the
pool
winding
down
every
night
with
a
comforting
massage
i
would
recommend
this
hotel
not
only
for
the
pure
elegance
but
for
the
wonderful
customer
service
and
the
fantastic
amenities

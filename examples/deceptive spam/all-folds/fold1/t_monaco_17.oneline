deluxe
room
for
nights
we
reserved
the
room
through
the
hotel
website
with
aaa
discount

paid

enjoy
boutique
hotels
as
they
have
so
much
more
personality
and
personal
service
this
hotel
was
no
exception
every
employee
we
encountered
was
pleasant
and
helpful
the
room
was
clean
well
decorated
spacious
and
quiet
we
were
offered
at
check
in
a
room
with
a
view
but
warned
it
was
across
from
the
elevator
so
we
decided
to
take
the
quiet
large
room
with
no
view
the
location
of
the
hotel
was
perfect
for
us

saw
wicked
while
in

had
no
problem

to
the

also
walked
the
magnificient
mile
and
found
the
location

was
a
pleasurable
experience

stayed
at
the
chicago
hilton
for
three
nights
and
from
the
minute
we
walked
through
the
door
i
was
very
impressed
check
in
was
quick
easy
and
i
was
very
glad
that
we
were
able
to
check
in
despite
being
earlier
than
the
advertised
check
in
time
we
were
given
a
twin
room
with
two
bathrooms
which
was
brilliant
it
made
getting
ready
to
go
out
much
quicker
the
hotel
location
is
great
opposite
the
park
which
is
a
must
see
although
located
on
south
michigan
ave
it
is
easily
within
walking
distance
of
all
the
shops
and
sights
of
the
whole
of
michigan
ave
would
also
recommend
the
street
one
block
back
from
michigan
ave
for
good
shopping
for
breakfast
i
would
recommend
grabbing
a
muffin
croissant
or
bagel
from
the
bar
just
past
reception
rather
than
going
for
the
more
expensive
breakfast
in
the
restaurant
for
evening
entertainment
kitty
ogsheas
is
a
must
typical
irish
bar
with
good
drinks
and
live
music
finally
the
bed
at
hilton
chicago
is
the
most
comfortable
bed
ever
i
would
have
taken
it
home
if
i
could
definately
made
for
a
good
nights
sleep

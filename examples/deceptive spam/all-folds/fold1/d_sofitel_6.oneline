best
hotel
in
an
excellent
location
i
stayed
at
the
sofitel
chicago
water
tower
with
my
husband
and
kid
as
he
came
there
for
a
business
purpose
my
year
old
kid
was
jumping
on
the
bed
and
he
really
enjoyed
the
atmosphere
of
the
room
the
front
desk
people
were
too
welcoming
and
the
staffs
were
very
friendly
the
room
service
was
also
good
the
room
was
very
clean
and
the
bathrooms
are
so
good
i
like
the
decor
of
the
room
the
french
restaurant
in
sofitel
is
so
good
and
we
both
enjoyed
the
dining
i
will
surely
prefer
to
stay
in
sofitel
on
a
next
time

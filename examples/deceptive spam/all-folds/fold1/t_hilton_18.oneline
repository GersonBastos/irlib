i
stayed
at
this
hotel
over
the
weekend
of
the
chicago
bears
fan
convention
feb
march
the
hotel
is
beautiful
i
had
a
towers
room
i
had
a
decent
view
of
the
city
sears
tower
the
room
was
a
little
small
but
had
two
bathrooms
king
bed
the
tower
room
has
itgs
own
registration
area
and
comes
with
a
free
continental
breakfast
evening
snacks
and
free
sodas
throughout
the
day
the
registration
lounge
is
on
the
floor
and
overlooks
lake
michigan
the
hotel
was
full
but
service
was
excellent
the
location
is
convenient
but
there
are
a
number
of
homeless
people
within
a
block
or
two
especially
toward
the
el
train
we
loved
our
stay
at
this
hotel
and
never
had
to
take
a
cab
or
rent
a
car
i
will
stay
here
again
hilton
offered
a
sunday
night
free
on
their
website
with
a
day
stay
this
made
the
cost
reasonable
for
chicago
however
the
pavilion
restaurant
left
a
lot
to
be
desired
the
pub
on
the
first
floor
was
a
good
place
to
hang
out
and
have
a
drink

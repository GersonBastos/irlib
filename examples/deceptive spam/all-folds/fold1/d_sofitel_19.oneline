my
wife
and
i
recently
stayed
at
this
hotel
for
a
fun
anniversary
weekend
away
from
the
kids
upon
check
in
we
were
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
decor
the
location
to
so
many
downtown
attractions
and
the
attentiveness
of
the
staff
as
a
seasoned
traveler
for
business
i
consider
myself
somewhat
savvy
when
it
comes
to
service
and
accommodations
this
hotel
certainly
delivers
on
both
accounts
my
wife
and
i
had
not
intended
on
eating
in
the
hotel
restaurant
but
after
reviewing
the
menu
we
thought
we
would
give
it
a
try
wow
service
was
outstanding
and
the
food
was
amazing
we
truly
enjoyed
our
dining
experience
all
in
all
i
would
not
hesitate
to
recommend
this
hotel
to
anyone
i
meet

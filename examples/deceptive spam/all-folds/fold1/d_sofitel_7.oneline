couldngt
have
asked
for
a
better
home
base
for
checking
out
downtown
chicago
hotel
sofitel
is
right
in
the
heart
of
the
action
allowing
my
friends
and
i
to
hit
the
clubs
and
enjoy
the
local
cuisine
downtowngs
famous
for
the
room
was
comfy
with
two
queen
mattresses
down
stuffed
duvets
and
chic
decor
the
bar
downstairs
was
a
bit
pricey
but
made
up
for
it
by
being
comfortable
sleek
and
staffed
with
attentive
bartenders
who
made
excellent
cocktails
one
night
we
didngt
feel
like
going
out
so
we
headed
downstairs
to
eat
at
the
cafe
des
architectes
which
had
an
amazing
array
of
choices
mostly
of
the
french
persuasion
i
would
definitely
book
here
again

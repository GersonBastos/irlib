my
family
and
i
have
just
had
a
two
week
holiday
in
chicago
and
we
stayed
for
a
week
at
the
hilton
towers
we
had
a
fantastic
time
and
enjoyed
every
minute
of
our
stay
at
this
incredible
hotel
the
sheer
size
of
the
place
is
breathtaking
and
the
atmosphere
is
very
friendly
and
hospitable
if
you
prefer
discreet
modern
boutiquey
type
hotels
maybe
this
wouldngt
be
your
thing
however
if
you
enjoy
old
style
glamour
and
glitz
you
will
be
bowled
over
by
this
hotel
the
place
literally
sparkles
thanks
to
the
enormous
chandeliers
that
are
everywhere
in
the
lobby
tons
of
celebs
have
stayed
here
over
the
decades
and
the
history
of
the
hotel
and
past
guests
etc
is
fascinating
we
got
a
very
reasonable
rate
for
our
stay
and
could
not
fault
anything
about
this
very
special
place
